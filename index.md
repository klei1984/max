M.A.X. Port is an [SDL library](https://wiki.libsdl.org/) based runtime executable for the 1996 DOS game M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault & Exploration developed and published by Interplay Productions.

The goal of the project is to fix the game breaking [defects](defects.md) present in the original game executable and to create a runtime that natively runs on modern operating systems.

M.A.X. Port requires the original game data. The port only provides a modernized executable.
