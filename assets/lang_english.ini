1471=This world is named for the shape of its only landmass. If participants on this world are placed too close together, a production strategy is unlikely to work.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: Games on this land mass can be very short unless the combatants are well separated.
c336=This area is likely to need a full deployment of land, sea, and air forces. A force starting on the same land mass as another might abandon their base camp and striking out for another land mass to start over.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Games in this area are likely to be long.
f40f=These chunks of ice poking up out of the frozen sea are widely enough separated that participants should have plenty of time to build up naval and air forces to pursue their goals.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Games in this area are likely to be long.
6c6c=This single land mass with surrounding islands is so small that two participants starting on the mass makes immediate contact with the enemy very likely. Start on one of the outlying islands to gain plenty of time for force increase.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: Games in this area can be very short.
8d9a=Participants who land on one of the smaller land masses should have plenty of time to build production before encountering an opponent. Landing two on the same land mass will cause instant combat.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Games in this area are likely to be long.
cb1d=The nature of this land mass makes construction of water platforms mandatory for a successful colonization. The chance of a preemptive strike by an opponent is high, though not as high as from other single-land areas.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: Games in this area should be of medium to long length.
5195=A starting position on one of the outlying islands almost ensures a long time for buildup before contact is made with an enemy.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: A long game unless the participants are all started in close proximity on the main continent.
012c=This archipelago of closely placed islands could be the scene of an entirely land and bridge based campaign, though sea and air assets would be useful.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Likely to be long unless there are only two participants and they both land on the same island.
323e=Only these few islands peak up from the omnipresent muddy seas of this world. The islands are sufficiently scattered that sea and air elements are necessary for any successful endeavor.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: This is likely to be a long campaign.
2385=Named for the heart-shaped great lake in the center of the land mass, this world can be won by land and air forces alone, but the use of sea forces in the central lake could be crucial.\nNumber of Participants: Two to four can be easily accomodated.\nGame Time: This is likely to be a long campaign.
6f14=The name of this world refers to the three lakes encompassed by the otherwise solid land mass of the world. There is a chance that a production-first strategy can run afoul of a preemptory strike by another participant.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: Probably short.
708f=This world has a lot of space and virtually every land mass has plenty of room for large armies. Depending on initial placements, the islands might see no activity at all. If every place is populated, expect intense seaborne combats.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Most games in this location will be long.
6903=This archipelago is tightly grouped in the middle of the planetary sea. There are opportunities for extensive air and sea resources, though an entirely land-and-air-based campaign could be successful.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: varies greatly depending on the landing points of the participants.
4d80=The useful parts of this world are split apart by a central sea. Control of the central sea with seaborne assets will be essential unless the participants all land on the same continent.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: will be long unless two participants land close together.
ae4e=This world is generally resourceless except for the region around the impact crater from a major asteroid strike. A combatant can win using just land and air forces. However, control of the inner sea could be important.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: the game can be very long.
d0a4=This archipelago with a slice of mainland is suited to a balanced combined arm force with extensive resource building. Taking sanctuary from the incessant naval action on the slice of mainland is a legitimate tactic, of course.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: The game will probably be long.
fdd7=This archipelago is best suited to a concentration on sea borne forces. Extensive engineering will be necessary to create areas for proper exploitation of the planetary resources.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: The necessary construction makes this a long game.
0ac0=The extensive land area on this planet makes it ideal for extensive land-based warfare. Sea borne assets may play a necessary but secondary role, depending on initial placement.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: this is likely to be a long game.
5f4b=This planet gets its name from its appearance when seen from space. The mountains jutting out of the desert give it a decidedly freckled appearance. There might be extensive use of naval assets, or none.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Most games in this location will be long games.
8475=Very few lumps of sand poke out of the ocean on this planet. Its situation demands heavy use of water platforms and naval assets. Two participants are very unlikely to end up on the same land mass.\nNumber of Participants: Two to three participants is preferable.\nGame Time: Most games in this location will be long games.
cffe=Like any other world where all the land is connected, this can be very risky for a high-production strategy. However, its size does give some protection against a preemptive strike by another participant.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: medium to long unless participants' landing points are close.
7842=The sea passage that separates the two main land masses makes naval action likely here. Those who wish to follow a production strategy might land on the island to the north east.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: this is likely to be a long game.
da7e=The central island of this planet makes a natural battleground for all participants, whether they start there or not. Start on one of the corner lands t gain a reasonable amount of time for a strategic buildup.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Games on this world are likely to be very long.
6517=This world gets its name from the land bottleneck controllable by sea forces and the sea bottleneck controllable by land forces. Both are in the center of the map. Extensive use of all forces is likely in this location.\nNumber of Participants: two to four can be easily accommodated.\nGame Time: Most games on this world are likely to be very long.
