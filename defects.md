The article maintains a comprehensive list of game defects that are present in the original M.A.X. v1.04 runtimes.

Fixed 151 / 234 (64.5%) original M.A.X. defects in M.A.X. Port.

1. **[Fixed]** M.A.X. is a 16/32 bit mixed linear executable that is bound to a dos extender stub from Tenberry Software called DOS/4G*W* 1.97. The W in the extender's name stands for Watcom which is the compiler used to build the original M.A.X. executable. A list of defects found in DOS/4GW 1.97 can be found in the [DOS/4GW v2.01 release notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20180611050205/http://www.tenberry.com/dos4g/watcom/rn4gw.html). By replacing DPMI service calls and basically the entire DOS extender stub with cross-platform [SDL library](https://wiki.libsdl.org/) the DOS/4GW 1.97 defects could be considered fixed.

2. **[Fixed]** If the game cannot play the intro movie, INTROFLC (maxint.mve), it tries to load and render a full screen Interplay logo image, ILOGO, which was removed from the game resource database max.res. The game continues gracefully after failing to open the ILOGO resource.
<br>
The game supports loading game resources from a secondary resource file called patches.res. The file does not exist in v1.04, but when created the contents of it are processed as expected. ILOGO is taken from the interactive demo of M.A.X. where the resource exists.

3. **[Fixed]** M.A.X. utilizes a user interface and OS-abstraction library called GNW for windowing, context menus, file system access, memory management, debug services, database management, human interface input recording and playback and many more. Several game menus create list controls for unit selection. When such list controls hold no items, the lists are empty, out of bounds access could occur. Based on dosbox debug sessions such accesses read random memory contents within low address space memory areas and operations conclude gracefully without crashes on DOS systems. On modern operating systems such out of bounds accesses cause segmentation faults and the game crashes immediately. UnitTypeSelector::Draw() (cseg01:00070CE3) is affected by this defect.

4. **[Fixed]** M.A.X. allocates 5 player objects. The fifth player is used for alien derelicts and is a very late addition to the game. Certain init routines (cseg01:0009DC7B) initialize arrays holding structures related to player data. Some arrays have four elements while the others have five elements. The structures held in these mixed size arrays are indexed from 4 to 0 in a loop. This creates an out of bounds write access to a totally unrelated memory area for the array that only holds four structure instances. The given structure is 19 bytes long and who knows what gets corrupted by the out of bounds write accesses.

5. **[Fixed]** M.A.X. has several units that were planned and never released for the final game or that were repurposed during game development. There is a mobile unit called the **Master Builder** which can be seen in one of the shorter movie clips of the game and has the following unit description text: *Specialized vehicle which transforms to become a new mining station.* The related game assets, like unit sprites, were removed from the game and all available demos. Never the less the unit is initialized by one of the UnitInfo class constructors (cseg01:000E9237) and when mandatory game resources are not found a NULL pointer dereference occurs. Like in case of defect 3 the game does not crash with out of bounds access under DOS environment but utterly fails on modern operating systems with a segmentation fault.
The following resources are missing from max.res or patches.res: A_MASTER, I_MASTER, P_MASTER, F_MASTER, S_MASTER, MASTER.

6. **[Fixed]** The voice interface always accepts two resource indices. The reason for this is that in most cases several alternative voice samples are available for an event or action which improves immersion. So there is always a start marker, which is excluded, and a last included sample index. The game selects from the defined voice sample range in a pseudo random manner, but thanks to the implementation it is guaranteed that the start marker plus 1 is the smallest resource ID that could be chosen. There is a defect in one of the functions (cseg01:0008E881) where the play voice API is called without a valid range. Instead of a start marker and a valid resource ID the start marker is fed into the API function twice. E.g. play_voice(V_M283, V_M283). Probably the defect was not found by the original developers as in such a failure case the start marker plus 1 is played which coincidentally is the resource ID that is supposed to be played. Resource ID V_F283 corresponds to the "Mission Successful!" voice sample.

7. **[Fixed]** The load_font() function (cseg01:00109F6C) in GNW's text.c module leaks a file handle in case the requested amount of character descriptors cannot be read from the font file.

8. **[Fixed]** The text_remove_manager() function (cseg01:0010A164) in GNW's text.c module could perform out of bounds read access to an array of structures in corner cases.

9. **[Fixed]** The text_remove_manager() function (cseg01:0010A164) in GNW's text.c module is supposed to remove a previously created text manager instance. Instead of linked lists and dynamic memory allocation the module supports maximum ten managers that could be stored in a preallocated array. E.g. to remove a manager from array position 3 the function would simply shift managers 4-9 to positions 3-8 overwriting position 3 in the process. The function uses memmove() which allows overlapping source and destination addresses which is good. The problem is that the data size to move is defined by count * sizeof(FontMgrPtr) instead of count * sizeof(FontMgr). The structure is 20 bytes long while its pointer is just 4 on 32 bit platforms. In sort this GNW API function is broken. Maybe this is the reason why M.A.X. does not even call it.

10. **[Fixed]** The tm_click_response() internal GNW function within the interface.c module is a GNW button on mouse click release event handler which returns a result code in the original implementation. The button module's ButtonFunc function prototype defines void return type and thus the button module does not expect any return value. The b_value parameter is incremented in certain cases within the handler, but the changed value is basically lost. As M.A.X. does not use the services that rely on this handler it is not clear whether this could cause any negative side effects. Fixed by removal of caller.

11. **[Fixed]** AI endlessly loads units into a depot and then unloads them to load another.
    <br>
    <video class="embed-video" preload="metadata" controls loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_11.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <br>
    The depot contains 12 units which is the maximum it can hold. Moving a unit into and out from a depot does not cost movement points for the unit if it stands next to the depot. The AI is able to perform other tasks parallel which indicates that the issue is not related to code runaway. The game UI is partly unoperational though. For example clicking on the Preferences button pops up the GUI element, but afterwards clicking on the Files button crashes the game. The AI loop does not end even when the end turn timer counts down to zero.
    <br>
    <br>
    The TaskRepair class has a method (cseg01:0006C085) that manages relevant unit state changes. In the given defect scenario there are two participants in the operation. There is a stationary repair shop and a mobile unit that needs to be repaired. A mobile unit that could be upgraded also counts as a unit that needs to be repaired. The class member method considers only two possible state changes. Either the mobile unit is successfully loaded into the repair shop or it needs to be ordered to enter the same. Moving to and entering a repair shop means that the unit first moves next to the repair shop, then it is shrunk down (unit loading effect), finally it is removed from hash maps and added to the repair shop to be managed there. When rescaling of the unit is finished, the applicable function (cseg01:001016BD) tests whether the repair shop that takes the unit has free capacity. The free capacity could be tested in two different ways. One method is to check the applicable unit’s `storage` member variable, the other method is to enumerate all movable units that have configured the repair shop as their parent unit. The latter method is reliable, the earlier one is not (the root cause of the defect). The applicable function uses of course the unreliable method and rejects the final step to load the unit into the repair shop. Again, the class member function only knows two unit states. Either the unit is loaded, this is not the case, or it needs to be ordered to load the unit. In short, part of the algorithm uses the reliable method to tell whether there is free capacity in the repair shop and wants to load the target unit while the other part says no this is not possible. This creates an endless loop which blocks the computer from finishing its turn.
    <br>
    <br>
    Proposed defect fix:
    - The class method shall be prepared to take a third possible outcome namely, that the repair shop is full so the task manager should reschedule the task execution for the next turn.
    - The class method shall not be allowed to request new move orders repeteadly until the last order reaches to a conclusion.
    - If the unit to be repaired is not adjacent to the repair shop yet, rendezvous tasks shall not be requested if one is already assigned to the unit and the repair shop.
    - As the defect root cause corrupted the storage level of repair shops and the corruption is saved into saved game files, making the issue persistent between game sessions, the corrupted storage values shall be corrected by the game.
    - The defect root cause shall be eliminated. As the root cause is not confirmed yet, add assertion tests to potential call sites.

12. Construction tape remains or is misplaced when AI constructor builds a building.
    <br>

    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_12.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    It is not allowed to instruct a unit to move to the coordinates found within the tape as the mouse hoover shows that the enemy constructor is found within those cells, but when a pathway is planned with shift + left mouse click the planned path crosses over the affected cells. When the constructor finishes the building the tape and the error remains. The tape and the unit referenced by the area remains even after the offending constructor is destroyed. Mouse hover also detects the constructor at cell 69-100. After finishing the building the unit might have left the construction area in that direction. This would indicate that the tape is not misplaced, but the process to remove the tape on finishing the building and moving the constructor out of the construction zone is bogus.

13. **[Fixed]** Infiltrator could stuck and game could hang if mine is on a bridge that the unit wants to pass to reach an otherwise inaccessible area.
    <br>
    <video class="embed-video" preload="metadata" controls loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_13.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    In case of water platforms the game correctly finds that there is no path to the destination. In case of bridges this is bogus. The infiltrator cannot take the path as there is a mine in the way, but the path finding algorith tells there is a valid path. When the issue occurs the game does not accept the end turn action, the affected infiltrator cannot be moved any more and it cannot be loaded by personnel carriers. The affected bridge at the same time is redrawn as if there would be a ship under the bridge. Interestingly it is possible to load back a game in this state and if done so the queued action to end the turn from the previous game activates. This also implies that command or event queues are not cleared on loading games.
    <br>
    The paths manager creates so-called access maps for teams. There is a function (cseg01:000BEAC8) to process all ground cover units including bridges, roads, sea and land mines. Access maps store distinct values instead of flags. The ground cover units are stored in an unordered list. When the list is iterated it could easily happen that a mine is found first which sets a grid cell access value to 0 (not accessible), then later a road or bridge or similar is found in the list at the same grid cell location which overwrites the previous access classification to non 0 (accessible). The paths manager eventually finds a path which is assigned to the applicable unit which starts to walk the path at some point and will find that there is a mine in the way so the path is invalid and another should be generated. But the path manager will give the unit the exact same path again as it does not know about the mine in the access map. Most of the time the game will simply spend all available turn time to generate and discard the same path again and again for computer players. In corner cases, like in case of defect 13 where the human player requested a path, the game will hang. The proposed solution is to process ground covers in at least two steps. First process everything but minefields, then finally only the minefields.

14. AI does not consider to leave a free square for engineer to leave the construction site making it stuck.

15. The in-game help mouse spot for the map coordinate display holder arm is at the old top left location. The arm was on top in the old v1.00 interactive demo and was moved to the bottom later. The developers forgot to move the hot spot with the art to its new location. The defect can only be fixed if asset HELP_ENG is updated.
<br>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/defect_15.jpg" alt="defect 14" width="740"> 

16. **[Fixed]** Clicking the help button on the landing site selection screen tries to set the rest state for the button control before it is actually created. The GUI control buttons are initialized just before the M.A.X. control panels open up, after selecting the landing site. The on click event handler function (cseg01:00094A4C) does not check whether the help button is pressed in-game when the help button's rest state is tried to be set. This issue, like many others, does not lead to a crash under DOS, but it causes segmentation fault on modern operating systems.

17. Unit gets stuck at map square that is occupied by constructor's construction tape. This issue was observed only once so far. As soon as it could be reproduced a video will be added for it. The issue happened with a computer player that moved two units at the "same" time. One unit moved to a certain location while another one, a big constructor, moved next to it and started a construction job.

18. First player to take turns gets 0 raw materials within the initial mining station's storage container on turn 1. Rest of the players get 14 raw materials. This is potentially a defect.

19. **[Fixed]** Certain reports menu screens could dereference NULL (mostly at game startup as long as some of the data is not filled in yet). See defect 3.

20. Targeting water tiles with the missile launcher's area attack hits underwater personnel carriers directly as well as indirectly, but the same cannot hit submarines at all. Ground attack planes can hit underwater personnel carriers as well as submarines. If any land or air unit hits an underwater personnel carrier it is revealed. An indirect area attack does not reveal the personnel carrier. In early builds the personnel carrier was not able to enter or pass the sea, it was a normal land unit only. It is assumed something is not working correctly here.

21. **[Fixed]** When the ini configuration file, MAX.INI, does not exist at game startup the original game (cseg01:000A5DB3) printed a message to standard output: "\nMANDER.INI File not found..  Using Defaults...\n". MANDER.INI should have been changed in the error message to MAX.INI after the developers changed the name of the game.

22. **[Fixed]** Configuration settings are not saved to non volatile storage medium unless the parsed MAX.INI file contains the relevant option already. This is odd as the original inifile manager would have supported addition and removal of ini file entries. Probably the default MAX.INI that is found on the CD-ROM contains the settings that the developers wanted the game to remember. On the other hand if the configuration file is not found by the game it dumps a new version which contains all the entires. The `enhanced_graphics` option is the only one which is lost on each startup as it was overridden in the original game by available system memory. The proposed defect fix allows users to save and load their user preference for the `enhanced_graphics` option. No other changes are made to the INI manager.

23. **[Fixed]** The game implements an exit(int status) like function (cseg01:0008F3A0) which prints exit code specific text to the standard output before the software terminates. One of the exit code outputs "\nMander INI not found.\n\n". Mander should have been changed in the exit code specific message to M.A.X. after the developers changed the name of the game.

24. **[Fixed]** The init function of the window manager (cseg01:00088923) sets outdated exit codes.

25. **[Fixed]** While enemy takes turn clicking an actively selected unit resets the flic animation's sequence. This is odd as the same cannot be observed while the player's turn is active.

26. **[Fixed]** The sound manager implements a method (cseg01:000DE1AE) to read meta data from audio files. If the audio file is not a RIFF WAVE file the method leaks its locally opened file handle. As all audio files in M.A.X. are RIFF WAVE format this is a latent defect only.

27. Unit names are typically constructed as follows Mark [version number] Type [Count]. The unit counter is stored by the game on a byte. In long games it is easy to have 300+ roads in which case the counter overflows. To fix this limitation the save file format version needs to be updated.

28. The game stores gold reserves for upgrades as a signed 16 bit word. Having a gold reserve of 32767+ does not crash the game, but it becomes impossible to purchase upgrades and it is also impossible to recover from this state via normal means. To fix this limitation the save file format version needs to be updated.

29. The game tracks team casualties. These counters are stored as 8 bit words and could overflow in very long games. Interestingly fighters and infiltrators have the highest death rates. To fix this limitation the save file format version needs to be updated.

30. **[Fixed]** The game implements lookup tables that map unit operating states to unit type and state specific sound effects. The size of lookup tables are dynamic. The first byte in the table defines the number of entries that follows. The default or common table, called UnitInfo_SfxDefaultUnit by the reimplementation, defines that the table has 20 entries even though there are only 18 entries provided in the table. There are 18 state specific sound effect types in total so it makes no sense to have tables bigger than that size. The sound manager searches in these tables and the method responsible to play sound effects (cseg01:000DD5C0) implements a for-loop to find the sound effect type specific sound effect in the lookup tables stopping the search as soon as a match is found. Due to this implementation it is guaranteed that a match will be found before the loop would do out of bounds access that may or may not lead to actual memory corruption or other issues. Proposed defect fix, use a standard vector instead of memory mapped rodata.

31. **[Fixed]** The game implements a set of wrapper functions for file operations like fopen, fread, fseek. On the other hand there are no wrappers for fclose, ftell, fwrite and so on. This is not actually a defect, but a strange design decision as the wrappers add no functionality at all and the game uses them inconsistently all around. The reimplementation removes the wrappers.

32. **[Fixed]** The default mouse action for a non anti air land unit is to attack a neutral bridge if an enemy flying entity is located in the cell.
    <br>
    <video class="embed-video" preload="metadata" controls loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_32.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    The video clip demonstrates that the cell below the enemy air transport is free to unload a land unit, but moving a stealth unit back to the free cell is not possible as the default action for the cell is to attack instead of move. For a cell where only a neutral bridge is present the default action is to allow movement there. As an infiltrator cannot attack a flying target and the bridge is a neutral entity the default action for such a cell should be to allow movment there, but the game incorrectly interprets the situation that the default action should be the attack. The proposed defect fix is to test whether the selected friendly unit is able to attack the enemy, non neutral,  unit type found at the target cell.

33. If a cell is occupied by an enemy land unit and an enemy air unit, possibly sea unit works as well, the game does not allow selection of the air unit. In case a cell is occupied by a neutral bridge and an enemy air unit, the air unit is selectable while the neutral bridge is not. This is more of a limitation or problem instead of a defect, but it should be solved.

34. Previously accepted AI kill unit task retriggers several times at the beginning of each team's turn to search for a valid path to the target in case there is no valid path to the moved target's new location. At the same time the voice advisor interface is spammed with "no path to destination" type of voice samples.
    <br>
    <video class="embed-video" controls loop playsinline>
    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_33.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    Opinion: it would be better to cancel the AI kill unit task in case there is no path to the destination any more and to add a new AI attack plan task instead. Rationale: The overall goal does not change this way. Problem: The game does not allow to issue a new AI kill unit or AI attack plan task if there is no valid path to the destination. To at least avoid the advisor voice spamming it would be possible to filter multiple voice events from the same voice category for the actively selected unit.

35. **[Fixed]** Similarly to defect 6 a cargo transfer related function (cseg01:00098F46) calls the play voice API with an invalid voice range. PlayVoice(V_M224, V_M224, PRIO_0) instead of PlayVoice(V_M224, V_F224, PRIO_0).

36. **[Fixed]** The ObjectArray base class uses memcpy() to shift data in its internally allocated buffer after removal (cseg01:0006DB14) of an array element. In case the destination and source addresses overlap memmove() is supposed to be used instead of memcpy() as the latter does not guarantee proper handling of overlapping memory areas. The original compiler's memcpy() implementation for example performs 32 bit word copy operations and only the final non 32 bit sized data chunk is copied per byte. This means that if the instantiated derived array class holds a type which has an element size that is smaller than 32 bits each removal could result in data corruption in all the elements that were held after the removed item. It is not yet confirmed whether there were any offending types though.

37. **[Fixed]** The TeamUnits class specific TextLoad method patches one of the unit ATTRIBS entires to disable the unit specific move & fire capability via code. Most probably the Infantry was the unit in question as it lost this capability during development. There are other inconsistencies between the human readable and binary parsers of TextfileObject based classes which indicates that after switching to binary format from the initial text based one the text parsers were not fully maintained.

38. **[Fixed]** The ScrollBar base class and therefore the derived LimitedScrollbar class forget to delete the Button class instance in their destructor (cseg01:00076E67) leaking heap memory at least 56 bytes at a time.

39. **[Fixed]** The play voice API is called with wrong voice range. PlayVoice(V_M229, V_F256, PRIO_0) is called when a unit is under attack and it does not gets destroyed (cseg01:00093C32). There are only four under attack type voice samples: V_F229 - V_F232 so the correct range would be PlayVoice(V_M229, V_F232, PRIO_0). It is not easy to test the failure scenario as a unit might be destroyed in a single shot and the API call could still randomly select a correct sample or a sample that does not exists so no incorrect sound would play.

40. **[Fixed]** The function (cseg01:000CB020) which builds network packet 41 (path blocked) forgets to set the packet header's *data_size* field so random garbage in random size is sent over the network. Typically a single byte of data is sent as the most common packet on the network has one data byte.

41. On the Network Game lobby screen clients cannot see the maps, load, scenarios and options buttons as these are only available for the host. The in-game help mouse spot areas for these buttons are not deactivated for clients.

42. Saving a game in multiplayer game modes via network packet 16 does not verify whether peers are already desynchronized. The game also does not check for desynchronization when a previously saved multiplayer game is loaded. This leads to situations where previously saved games are basically corrupted already at the time of loading.

43. The help button and the help feature in general does not work on the IPX multiplayer initial cargo setup screen.

44. When initial upgrades are made during mission loadout and the player proceeds to the landing zone selection screen then goes back to the purchase menu by pushing the cancel button the upgrades can be cancelled to get back the upgrade costs, but the game keeps the upgrades still. This can be used as an exploit in both single and multiplayer games where the purchase menu is available.

    <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_44.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    In multiplayer the purchased unit count must remain below 134 otherwise buffer overflows or other wicked stuff could happen.

45. The TeamInfo class still allocates space for the map markers feature (40 bytes) which was removed by the original developers before release. To fix this technical debt the save file format version needs to be updated.

46. The TeamInfo class allocates 6 slots for screen locations while only 4 locations can be saved and restored by the game logic. To fix this technical debt the save file format version needs to be updated.

47. The save file format header allocates 5 team instances for team type and team clan parameters but only 4 team instances are filled up with valid data. To fix this technical debt the save file format version needs to be updated.

48. **[Fixed]** There is a typo in the description of Valentine's Planet. `Two to four can be easily accomodated.` -> `accommodated.`

49. The resource levels panel of the game options menu allows to configure the amount of alien derelicts. The built-in help entry for the panel does not explain the meaning of alien derelicts indicating that the English help is older than the concept of alien derelicts. Additionally the "Alien Derelicts" caption is the only one without a colon within the panel.

50. **[Fixed]** The built-in help menu's popup window supports rendering multiple pages of text. If more than one page is needed to display the help entry arrow buttons are added to the window. The up arrow registers an sfx, the down arrow does not (cseg01:000A53E9). Interestingly neither is played by the game for some reason.

51. **[Fixed]** The game setup menu allocates char buffers to hold mission titles using new char[], but deletes (cseg01:000B12B5) the buffers using the delete operator instead of the delete[] operator which is undefined behavior.

52. **[Fixed]** The event handler of the scroll up button (cseg01:000B1035) on mission selection screens tests against an uninitialized local (stack) variable. In the extremely unlikely case when the test would pass the function does nothing to the GameSetupMenu class object's state as the function prematurely exits.

53. If a multiplayer game desyncs on the beginning of the first round before a new autosave is made, thus no autosave exists for the given game session, the game still asks whether players, any of them, wants to reload the last save.

54. The main menu setup and in-game preferences menu is implemented in one class. The game pause menu is not deactivated in the main menu by the setup window variant where it makes no sense to be active.

55. The game pause menu is not deactivated in the popup help menus from within the main menu.

56. Single player custom games test for at least two active players of any kind (computer and human) to be able to start a game. Hot seat games test for at least two human players to be selected. This means that it is possible to start a single player custom game without a human player. It is unclear whether this is a feature or a defect.

57. The custom scenarios menu title is "Multiplayer Scenarios" even in single player mode.

58. If a high-tech unit is captured, and then it gets upgraded in the depot, the unit would lose any of its superior unit values. For example if an enemy tank had 34 attack power and the player's own latest tank upgrades would only grant 20 attack power to an upgraded tank then the captured tank would lose the 34 attack power and would get the inferior 20 "as an upgrade". This behavior was considered to be a defect in M.A.X. 2 back in March, 1998.

59. **[Fixed]** The SaveSlot class has two image resources, FILEx_UP and FILEx_DN. The save load menu init function (cseg01:000D7A19) allocates memory for the images' data. The buffer size is determined for both images, but the allocation uses the size of FILEx_UP data for both. As both images have the same dimensions this defect does not cause any issues.

60. **[Fixed]** The function (cseg01:000C9093) which builds network packet 13 (update RNG seed) forgets to set the packet header's *entity_id* field so the previously configured packet's field value is used.

61. If an IPX client exits abnormally while it is in an IPX network lobby the host and its other peers will not be able to proceed with their game creation process. The only way to continue game creation is to exit the lobby by the host and start the connection process again from scratch. Adding a visual marker for ready state and adding the ability for the host to kick an unresponsive client could resolve the issue.

62. **[Fixed]** The ButtonManager class (cseg01:00089450) allocates ButtonID buffers with new[] but deletes the buffer with free which is undefined behavior. It worked under Watcom 10.x compiler.

63. The AI misbehaves when a hidden infiltrator steps aside, but doing so reveals its presence to the enemy.

    In this case the AI thinks that the infiltrator stands at the old grid cell position and offloads all shots onto the empty ground. Eventually the AI will "learn" the correct location too and may terminate the revealed infiltrator.

64. Disabled alien attack planes placed as alien derelicts onto the maps do not set the map pass tables to unpassable.

    The path generator lets ground units pass these planes. This defect could be used as an exploit to give an edge against human players. If a unit's remaining moves in a turn are calculated well, then it is possible to stop exactly under the plane. The mini map will show the alien derelict's team color (team 5, yellow) instead of the player unit's color. If the grid cell gets attacked, the player unit is not damaged as the alien unit is targeted by the game.

65. **[Fixed]** The ResourceManager_InitTeamInfo() function (cseg01:000D6316) initializes 5 CTinfo structs. The last belongs to the alien derelicts team. The CTinfo structure's TeamType and ClanType fields are initialized from the MAX.INI file's red_team_player to gray_team_player and red_team_clan to gray_team_clan parameters. There is no alien_team_player nor alien_team_clan INI parameter so the alien CTinfo TeamType field is initialized from the red_team_clan INI parameter and the ClanType field is initialized from the DIGITAL INI group ID (returns 0 which corresponds to RANDOM clan).

66. If a unit is selected the primary selection marker starts to blink at a 1 second rate. If a multiselect rectangle is redrawn by clicking and dragging the mouse pointer the primary marker gets redrawn as well and its draw function toggles the marker state much faster. The primary marker should not start to blink like crazy in such events.

67. **[Fixed]** When a supply truck tries to reload a unit and it's storage container is empty the following alert message is shown: `insufficient material in storage to reload unit.`. The message should start with capital letter. Same goes for repairing a unit.

68. The path generator erroneously cannot find path to a cell location in corner cases. Note: the audio can be unmuted on this video clip.

    In the above case an airplane is hovering above a bridge which confuses the path generator.

69. The path generator inconsistently finds a path to a cell where it is questionable whether the given unit should be allowed to move at all. Note: the audio can be unmuted on this video clip.

    Is it intentional to allow ships to coast type cells in case there is a bridge at the same cell?

70. The allocation menu uses a function (cseg01:0008A5FB) to change color temperature of highlighted text background. When the algorithm finds a better color match in the system color palette based on color distance the worse distance is saved instead of the better one.

    </video>
    This makes the text background brighter now, but more importantly more detail is visible. Maybe in the future the blue color temperature could be made darker to match the original aesthetic keeping the higher level of detail.

71. There is a typo in the briefing text of stand alone mission 20 (DESCR20.SCE). `Can you affort to shut down` -> `afford`.

72. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:0008E881) to wrap up games and display the mission's end briefing. The function takes an ordered array with the places of teams and builds another local array later on with very similar content. In the beginning of the function the local yet to be initialized array is used to test which is the winner team in case of custom games instead of the array which was taken as a function argument by mistake.

73. **[Fixed]** The order of initialization of global variables across translation units is unspecified behavior in standard C++. The original SmartString class has a default constructor (cseg01:000E1AE8) which uses a globally constructed SmartString object instantiated by an overloaded constructor. The idea behind is that if new SmartString objects are created with the default constructor the class just increments internally its reference counter to a default empty string object. The problem with this approach is that nothing guarantees that the SmartString module's internal global variable will be initialized first before another module's global SmartString variable in which case the object for which the reference counter would be incremented does not exist yet and the application crashes with a null pointer dereference related segmentation fault at some point. It seems that the original solution worked in the old Watcom C/C++ compiler while it fails with GCC.

74. **[Fixed]** The function (cseg01:0009D3A7) that spawns all derelict alien units on the map uses rand() which generates pseudo random numbers. There is a code snippet that seeks a pseudo randomly selected alien unit that fits within a predetermined value budget. When such a unit is found the function deploys another pseudo randomly selected alien unit instead of reusing the unit type that was tested to actually fit into the budget. The code clearly wanted to select a unit within budget so spawning another one which may not fit must be a defect.

75. The functions (cseg01:0009CAE7, cseg01:0009C6F6) responsible for resource distribution on maps do not check whether the calculated grid coordinates are within map boundaries. In corner cases this could lead to heap memory corruption under DOS or in worst case could cause segmentation faults on modern operating systems (ResourceManager_CargoMap[]).

76. **[Fixed]** Dot is missing from end of sentence `%i %s upgraded to mark %s for %i raw material` in Upgrade All event handler function (cseg01:000F80FD). There are three possible messages: no upgrade, single unit upgrade, more then one unit upgrade. The messages are ended with dots for the first two, only the third one is inconsistent.

77. **[Fixed]** One of the access module functions (cseg01:000136D8) reads already released heap memory which leads to random crashes or even worse, to memory corruption.
```cpp
    UnitInfo* unit;
    SmartList<UnitInfo>::Iterator it;
    
    // the iterator is a smart pointer to a list node object which holds the list item and a reference to the next
    // and previous list node. The next and prev members are smart pointers to list nodes
    for (it = Hash_MapHash[Point(grid_x, grid_y)], unit = &*it; it != nullptr;) {
        if (((*it).flags & flags) && !((*it).flags & GROUND_COVER) && (*it).orders != ORDER_IDLE) {
            return &*it;
        }
        
        // the following code snippet removes the list item, the list node, from the hash map which means that the
        // last reference to the list item, which is held by the list node, is held by the iterator which is again
        // a reference counted smart pointer
        Hash_MapHash.Remove(&*it);
        Hash_MapHash.Add(&*it);
        
        // this is where the issue occurs as the iterator is moved which means that the last reference to our
        // list node is gone somewhere within the iterator's overloaded ++ operator
        ++it;
        
        ...
    }
    
    // this is how the iterator's ++ operator is implemented. The next member of the list node object
    // is a smart pointer which means that the smart pointer class uses the overloaded = operator that
    // takes another smart pointer by reference (by its address practically)
    Iterator& operator++() {
        SmartPointer<ListNode<T>>::operator=(this->object_pointer->next);
        return *this;
    }
    
    // this is how the = operator is implemented. The implementation takes into account the use case where the
    // other object could be the same as the this object. But it does not take into account that the object
    // that is held by the smart pointer might be a smart pointer like object.
    SmartPointer<T>& operator=(const SmartPointer<T>& other) {
        // the other object in this case is the list node's next member which has a reference count >= 1
        other.object_pointer->Increment();
        // the decrement operation decreases the current list node's reference count to zero so the held list node
        // object gets deleted. But that list node object's next member, which is a smart pointer to the next list
        // node also gets deleted! So the other argument, which is a reference, now points to released heap memory.
        // The heap deallocator implementation may fill up the released memory with a test pattern like 0xFEEEFEEE or
        // 0xDEADBEEF or similar. 
        object_pointer->Decrement();
        // So when the object_pointer is assigned to other.object_pointer potentially 0xFEEEFEEE offset by the object_pointer
        // member gets dereferenced and the software segmentation faults or worse.
        object_pointer = other.object_pointer;
    
        return *this;
    }
```
The issue can be resolved if the iterator ++ and \-\- operators pass object T reference to the smart pointer instead of the smartpointer itself as follows.
```cpp
    // bad, passes next which is a smart pointer to the list node object
    SmartPointer<ListNode<T>>::operator=(this->object_pointer->next);
    
    // good, passes the list node object (T) held by next so even if the list node is deleted and the next member of it gets destroyed the object T is still valid
    SmartPointer<ListNode<T>>::operator=(&*this->object_pointer->next);
```
On modern operating systems the deallocated heap memory could be reallocated by another thread or process before the next list node gets assigned so memory corruption or crashes might still occur even if the heap deallocator does not fill the released memory with nasty bug trapping test patterns. On DOS this is highly unlikely so there this defect was assumably latent.

78. **[Fixed]** The Engineer and Constructor specific popup context menu button list initializer function (cseg01:000F9304) tests whether the units are building `order = build and order_state != 13 and order_state != 46` and either adds the Stop or the Build button to the button list. The last test in the original code is `order != 46` which is always true of course as there is no such order ID. In case the order state would be 46, whatever that means, the wrong button would be presented to the user. Interestingly the button on click event handler is the same function so the test and the button label is defective, but the outcome of the event will be the same action.

79. **[Fixed]** The function (cseg01:0009C6F6) responsible for resource distribution on maps uses an uninitialized variable by mistake. Fixing this issue potentially alters the original resource distribution probabilities.

80. Units that can pass land as well as water do not update the sprite base frame index after they are picked up from water by air transport and dropped down onto land.

    The transporter's activate event should check the destination cell type.

    This is not the only flickering behaviour.

83. **[Fixed]** The function (cseg01:000CE775) responsible for the reports menu's mouse left click event handling tests against incorrect window boundaries. The active draw area is 459 x 448 pixels. The on click event handler checks for 459 x 459 pixels by calling Image::GetWidth() for both x and y axis dimensions. this must be a simple copy paste error.

84. The reports menu constructor (cseg01:000CC8D0) calls GNW win_draw() twice right after each other. First a call is enabled by the class specific draw function via function parameter, then right after the draw function there is another call.

85. Enemy land units do not sink or get destroyed after a water platform or similar is demolished beneath them. The units can also move from a water cell back to a land cell if it is next to them. Land mines do not get destroyed if the structure below them gets demolished. Sea mine layers can detect floating land mines too. Building a landing pad above a road above a water platform makes the road disappear. Further investigation is required whether the road unit gets "properly" destroyed or is it leaking memory. Destroying a landing pad above a water platform while an aircraft is landed there leaves the aircraft on the ground in awaiting state. The aircraft is targetable in this state by land units. The aircraft can take off into air from the water mass.

    In my opinion land mines should also blow up just like connectors and roads built above water platforms and bridges do. Any non hybrid land unit should sink to the bottom of the sea too. If an aircraft is landed on a landing pad on a water platform and the landing pad gets demolished the aircraft should either take off into air, or should sink to the bottom of the sea.

86. **[Fixed]** The maxsuper cheat code increases the scan and attack ranges. The game redraws the markers incorrectly until there is a movement of screen or unit.

87. Both the TaskMineAssisstant and TaskFrontierAssistant classes have the same type id. It is not known yet whether this is a copy paste error or done on purpose in which case it would be an unnecessary design decision not a defect. There are other tasks with equal type identifiers too.

88. **[Fixed]** The TaskRemoveRubble task implements a function (cseg01:0003A57F) to dump cargo to the closest complex. This task is used by computer players. The algorithm first searches for a building A that could store some of the raw materials that the bulldozer or mine layer or similar holds, then searches for the closest building B within the same complex of the previously found building A and orders the bulldozer to move to **building A** instead of the closest building within the complex which would be building B. It is another topic why Supply Trucks with free capacity are not even considered by the AI or that it is not even checked how much raw materials can be stored within the selected complex.

89. Both the TaskConnectionAssistant and TaskPowerAssistant classes have the same type id. It is not known yet whether this is a copy paste error or done on purpose in which case it would be an unnecessary design decision not a defect. There are other tasks with equal type identifiers too.

90. **[Fixed]** The TaskCreateUnit task implements a function (cseg01:00038CC9) that tries to optimize resource consumption so that demanded units could be created (faster). If necessary the algorithm tries to increase fuel reserves by shutting down inessential infrastructure, namely Eco-Spheres and Gold Refineries. There is a copy paste error when counting the inessential building types so Eco-Spheres are tested twice, counted once, and Gold Refineries do not add to the count. Due to this defect basically Gold Refineries are not considered at all by the algorithm. The proposed defect fix is to consider Gold Refineries as inessential infrastructure in the given context. This change assumes that the original developers did not intentionally change the second condition and left in the dead code snippets for fast reiterations later.

91. **[Fixed]** The TaskManager implements a method (cseg01:00043F3F) to estimate the total heap memory usage by the AI. The game introduced a priority list for reminders in one of the post release patches and instead of considering the dynamic memory usage of the priority reminders list it considers the count of reminders stored by the list by calling the wrong smart list function. Due to this and other similar defects the overall memory usage was probably underestimated by the developers. The game places huge buffers on the stack as well which makes stack usage hard to estimate. GNW supported custom C memory allocators that could measure dynamic memory usage, but as M.A.X. is mostly implemented in C++ this GNW feature was somewhat useless. The feature was disabled in release builds. The feature is defective and not useful anymore so it is removed together with the relevant Task virtual methods.

92. **[Fixed]** The DefenseManager class tracks the unit types it needs in a SmartObjectArray\<ResourceID\> object and the units it already manages in a SmartList\<UnitInfo\> object. If a new unit is added to the manager the given unit type is removed from the array of needed unit types and the unit is added to the list of managed units. The method (cseg01:0001D2C8) responsible for this operation calls the SmartObjectArray\<ResourceID\>::Remove() method which attempts to remove an array element by index or position while the manager method passes the unit type which is obviously not equal to the array position where the unit type was originally stored. No memory corruption occurs as the SmartObjectArray is intelligent enough not to remove elements from beyond the allocated size of the array. But the algorithm is totally broken that relies on the unit type array contents. The root cause of the defect is probably a misunderstood interface as while the SmartList\<UnitInfo\>::Remove() API searches for the passed element instance and if found it is removed from the linked list the SmartObjectArray\<ResourceID\>::Remove() behaves totally different.

93. There is a function to evaluate assaults (cseg01:00018D4A) which first reads the team member from a UnitInfo object pointer and afterwards tests whether the pointer was null.

94. **[Fixed]** The TaskManageBuildings class implements a method (cseg01:00030C63) which processes a two dimensional matrix. The matrix dimensions are supposed to be the same as the game map grid dimensions. Instead of the X and Y axes the Y axis is used twice in a loop. As the game only implements fixed 112 x 112 grid maps the defect is latent.

95. **[Fixed]** The TaskManageBuildings class implements a method (cseg01:0003177D) which marks path ways around buildings. The function also attempts to mark the path ways around buildings that are scheduled to be built, but the tasks list iterator variable is used in two loops and the second loop does not reinitialize the iterator to the beginning of the list effectively skipping the entire list of planned buildings.

96. The TaskManageBuildings class implements a method (cseg01:0003285C) which determines whether a site is reasonably safe for construction purposes. There is a minor risk that `++marker_index` might lead to out of bounds access that could smash the stack and depending on the calling convention of the ABI this could lead to code runaway.

97. **[Fixed]** The TaskManageBuildings class implements a method (cseg01:00033E27) to get the amount of units of a particular type a team has and plans to build. The method returns the count on 8 bits. Over long game sessions it is possible to have more than 255 units of the same type in which case the result gets truncated that could lead to unintended AI behaviors in corner cases.

98. Depending on the zoom level the draw order of shadows could become incorrect in corner cases.

100. **[Fixed]** It is possible to take control over non friendly mobile units or reactivate friendly disabled units and exploit this in various ways. Thanks for Sal from the M.A.X. Reloaded community for reporting this issue.

The defect is closely related to the group command. Steps to reproduce the issue: left click an enemy mobile unit that has unspent movement points and is not building. Press down the shift key and left click a friendly mobile unit with unspent movement points. This creates a new unit group which places the enemy and the friendly units into the same player controlled group. Left click once more on the friendly unit to make it the actively selected unit instead of the enemy. Now the shift key can be released. Order the friendly unit to move somewhere and the enemy unit will follow the movement direction and distance as long as this is possible.
- If the enemy unit is a bulldozer that is clearing a site the game will let the bulldozer unit leave the work zone corrupting the game and unit states affecting game save files too.
- If the enemy unit is a mine layer that is laying or removing mines, the enemy unit will continue to lay or remove mines.
- If the enemy unit is actually a disabled alien derelict unit, it could be reactivated this way and computer players will consider them as threats typically destroying their own potential assets.
- If the enemy unit reserves shots as a defensive measure, we can deplete their reserves unless the unit has the Move & Fire attribute.
- The enemy unit can be deliberately moved over a mine to get it blown to pieces.
- The enemy unit can be moved to a location where it is not anymore protected by defensive structures like missile launchers or stationary anti-aircraft turrets or units that could detect infiltrators.
- A disabled friendly mobile unit could be immediately reactivated this way. It is sufficient to select the disabled unit together with any other disabled or non disabled unit and the multi selection action removes the disabled state. Such defective reactivations also corrupt heat maps.

     The defective function (cseg01:00099465) tests whether the unit which is attempted to be added to the existing selection belongs to the player team, but it assumes that the originally selected unit belongs to the team as well without testing it. The proposed defect fix is to test both units involved in the process.

     The defective functions (cseg01:00099465, cseg01:00015537) do not test whether the units to be part of the selection are disabled by infiltrators. The proposed defect fix is to test disabled state of participating xunits.

101. **[Fixed]** The units manager module implements a function (cseg01:00100464) to transfer materials. The function sets up two smart pointers. One for the cargo source unit which is initialized to the UnitInfo object that is given as function argument and another for the cargo destination unit which is initialized using the previous UnitInfo object's parent unit. Depending on the sign of the cargo amount to transfer between the two units the source and destination smart pointers to the units may be swapped. After performing the transfer the function checks whether the unit information panel on the GUI needs to be updated. An update to the GUI is required if the currently selected unit is affected by the transfer. The function compares the currently selected unit against the unit which was the input argument to the function and the destination unit which is held by one of the smart pointers. As in case of negative transfer amounts the two smart pointers are swapped, it could happen that the unit held by the source smart pointer is not tested by the function. The function should have simply tested the source and destination smart pointers instead of the input argument plus one of the smart pointers. The defect could be considered latent as the GUI is rendered in every frame anyways.

102. **[Fixed]** The AiPlayer class implements a method (cseg01:000627F0) to filter out stationary or regenerating units from weight tables. When weight tables are initialized unit types that are not allowed to be built during a scenario or training mission are saved into the tables with the unit type set to INVALID_ID. The method iterates through the weight table entries and uses the unit type as index into the BaseUnit base units array. The INVALID_ID has a value of -1 represented as 0xFFFF on 16 bits or 0xFFFFFFFF on 32 bits. On modern operating systems such out of bounds accesses, `UnitsManager_BaseUnits[INVALID_ID].flags`, could cause segmentation faults and the game could crash immediately. The original game under DOS could potentially corrupt a byte by setting it to zero at a semi random address.

103. **[Fixed]** The AiPlayer class implements a method (cseg01:0006317C) that enumerates unit types that could fight against a targeted enemy unit type and stores the results into a weight table. When weight tables are initialized unit types that are not allowed to be built during a scenario or training mission are saved into the tables with the unit type set to INVALID_ID. The method filters out unit types that cannot get within range of the enemy unit type due to the map surface by iterating through the weight table entries and testing the unit type flags using the BaseUnit base units array. The INVALID_ID has a value of -1 represented as 0xFFFF on 16 bits or 0xFFFFFFFF on 32 bits. On modern operating systems such out of bounds accesses, `UnitsManager_BaseUnits[INVALID_ID].flags`, could cause segmentation faults and the game could crash immediately. The original game under DOS could potentially corrupt a byte by setting it to zero at a semi random address.

104. **[Fixed]** The TaskKillUnit class implements a method (cseg01:0001BAD5) to gather friendly unit types that can fight against an enemy unit type. The method uses a weight table which could contain INVALID_ID as unit type. Weights of unit types are set to 0 if the unit type cannot be built before the final turn of the mission or in case the unit types are regenerating types. The conditions are tested using the BaseUnit base units array and the unit type as index. Using INVALID_ID as array index, `UnitsManager_BaseUnits[INVALID_ID].flags`, could lead to segmentation faults and the game could crash immediately. The original game under DOS could potentially corrupt a byte by setting it to zero at a semi random address.

105. **[Fixed]** The master builder unit type has no sprite and shadow assets. Due to this the unit asset loader method does not set the sprite_bounds and shadow_bounds members of the UnitInfo class before use. The members are not initialized by the UnitInfo constructors either. There is a function (cseg01:000E9FA8) to report new dirty zones for the renderer. As the master builder sprite and shadow bounds are uninitialized random garbage, the renderer is presented with potentially ill formed data. The sprite and shadow bounds should be initialized to safe default values by the UnitInfo constructors. Additionally the function that takes new dirty zones could potentially discard any bounds that have no valid size. The master builder unit is used by the game during the landing zone selection screen. A master builder unit is spawned at the selected landing spot.

106. The ini file module implements a function (cseg01:000C36AC) to save an ini configuration file and release internal buffers. The internal buffer memory is leaked in case the ini file cannot be opened.

107. The main menu setup and in-game preferences windows do not exit active edit menus when the user presses the help button. Pressing most buttons emit keyboard key or scan codes. In case of the help button a question mark is emitted which is fed into the active edit control instead of switching to active help mode in the given context menu. Pressing the help button shall exit the edit control just like enter and escape and similar buttons do.

108. **[Fixed]** The game manual (MN-ICD-082-0) incorrectly spells `Albert Olsen for Four Bars Intertainment` as `Albert LIoyd Olson for Four Bars Entertainment`. The in-game credits is correct.

109. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:000CEB0D) to enumerate team units to be considered for the reports menu. Only such units are added to the list that fulfill certain conditions. There is a condition that says if the unit order is IDLE then the unit can be added to the list if the unit order is not MOVE_TO_ATTACK which is always true. There are many tests that check IDLE order and BUILDING_READY state in combination. The MOVE_TO_ATTACK order code and the BUILDING_READY state code are the same.

110. **[Fixed]** The units report window in the reports menu renders (cseg01:000CC088) unit statistics for the RESEARCH unit tpye incorrectly. The unit statistics shown should be Hits, Usage, Total while Hits, Usage, Usage is shown.

111. There is a function (cseg01:000FAA72) to initialize in-game popup context menu event handlers and some other possibly related resources that have something to do with delayed reactions. The team specific UnitsManager_TeamInfo structures are tested for their unit_type members even though the objects are initialized only at a later stage. Thus a delayed reactions related globally allocated static variable, UnitsManager_Team, is left to its default value which is PLAYER_TEAM_RED or set to a stale value from a previous game session.

112. Certain crater inland tiles use coastline color animation color palette indices which is assumed to be unintentional based on the visual look of the affected landscape elements.

113. There is a function to load saved games (cseg01:000D8EB6) that reads the saved game file header which redundantly contains the team name, type and clan specifications. Only the team name is used from the saved game file header. The function calls a resource manager function (cseg01:000D6316) to initialize TeamInfo objects which initializes TeamInfo objects with stale ini configuration settings for team type and clan specifications instead of using the specifications from the already read saved game file header. The init function is called from three different call sites implementing different game setup scenarios, thus to eliminate the use of stale data in case of loading a previously saved game the ini configuration settings needs to be updated based on the file header before the call to the TeamInfo initialization function. Defect 65 is also relevant for this issue.

114. The game logic does not consider whether a stealth unit would be revealed at a target location after stepping aside from an enemy unit. The sole purpose of stepping aside is to remain hidden. In the demonstrated scenario the enemy unit would have had sufficient movement or speed points to move to the west instead of east. Movement to the east is favored due to the cheaper movement costs even if that reveals the stealth unit.

117. Generic mission loss conditions do not consider the case when no mining stations remain, but we have at least one constructor unit and materials left to build a new one, although the constructor is not allowed to build mining stations in the given mission.

118. **[Fixed]** The in-game preferences menu implements a method (cseg01:000C29AD) to process human input. There is a corner case that leads to an out of bounds access. In a turn based game end the player's turn to start a computer turn. Press the in-game preferences button to open up the preferences window while the computer player is thinking. Close the preferences window by using the Done button. Open up the in-game preferences window a second time. Now press the files button in the background while the preferences window is still active. The preferences menu receives a key code of 4 while the minimum should be the virtual key code 1002 which results in an out of bounds access to a menu button array and the game crashes. The root cause of the issue is that there is a mechanism to disable the in-game menu buttons while popup windows are active which is triggered by the preferences window as well, but it does not work properly while computer players take turns. On opening up the preferences window the mechanism (cseg01:0009FC13) checks whether in-game menu buttons are enabled and if so the algorithm disables the in-game menu buttons and sets a state variable to disabled state. On exiting the preferences window the mechanism (cseg01:0009FA70) checks the state variable and if it is disabled state it enables back all buttons, but only sets the state variable to enabled again if the player that is taking its turn is a human one. The next time the preferences window is opened up the mechanism finds that the state variable is set to disabled state already and buttons in the background all remain active.

119. **[Fixed]** Certain missions, like most training missions, limit the type of units that could be constructed or manufactured. Computer players build weight tables that help them decide what type of units and buildings they need the most depending on the features or characteristics of the world and other aspects. In case a unit type is disabled in a given mission the INVALID_ID unit type value is used replacing the original unit type. There is a function (cseg01:000198DE) that ignores the fact that list elements may use the INVALID_ID unit type value which is -1 or 0xFFFF if the value is interpreted as an unsigned array index in which case out of bounds access is attempted to a local stack array that leads to random crashes or even worse, to memory corruption.

120. **[Fixed]** The constructor of the TransferMenu class (cseg01:00104C63) instantiates a Button class object for an arrow icon which is not destructed by the destructor (cseg01:0010564C). This defect leaks at least 56 bytes of heap memory after each cargo transfer.

121. **[Fixed]** Heat maps of the units manager class are allocated in heap memory by various initialization functions. The alien derelicts team is handled in a special way by most initialization routines probably because aliens were added to the game late in the development process (alien derelicts are just a hack in the code base). The function responsible to clean up heat maps forget to delete the alien heat maps. This defect leaks at least 36.75 KiB of heap memory per game session.

122. **[Fixed]** Computer players may request new or alternative ground paths with a maximum path cost set to zero in case the unit's actual speed points are all depleted. The paths manager processes given ground path requests in two stages. First a viable path is generated to the destination and if found the unit gets the part of the path that it can take in the given turn up to the limit of the maximum path cost. If the maximum cost is set to zero it means that the unit cannot move at all which means that if a viable path is found to the destination a GroundPath object that is instantiated will contain an empty steps array. Dereferencing an empty smart array results in an out of bounds access. Such accesses read random memory contents and operations conclude gracefully without crashes on DOS systems. On modern operating systems such out of bounds accesses cause segmentation faults and the game crashes immediately. The GroundPath method (cseg01:000BA570) that dereferences the steps array checks the unit speed points, which is zero, and stops processing the already read random garbage step data.
The proposed defect fix will not instantiate a ground path if the determinted path (cseg01:000BCE26) steps up to the maximum path cost is zero and the maximum path cost will be based upon the unit's base speed value instead of the actual speed points remaining.

123. **[Fixed]** The MenuLandingSequence class is instantiated by the game as a static global object. The class implements a method to initialize user interface controls, like buttons or images, on demand. Destruction of the static global object is performed at some point by the C++ runtime while the application is being terminated. If the user interface controls were not deinitialized by the application, the destructor (cseg01:0009133A) attempts to do so by calling the related class method. When GNW or the application detects an unrecoverable error an exit-like function is called that cleans up after GNW freeing all window manager resources in the process. In corner cases the MenuLandingSequence class interface controls are initialized by the application, but then the application detects an error before calling the deinitialization method. GNW calls the exit-like function that frees the window manager resources and finally the static global class object destructor is called by the C++ runtime that deletes the previously initialized user interface controls, like buttons, that attempt to read from the already freed window surface they belonged to and also attempt to write pixels to the window surface from within their destructors. This leads to out of bounds read and write accesses under DOS systems that lead to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

124. **[Fixed]** The function (cseg01:000198DE) that is described in defect 119 has another similar defect. The function checks whether the manufacturer of a desired unit type is available already or one has to be manufacted as well. If the assessed team already has a unit from the manufacturer unit type it is removed from the list of desired unit types. The weight of the unit type is set to zero. There are unit types, like the alien gun boat (juggernaut), that cannot be produced by any of the plants. In such cases the manufacturer unit type is set to INVALID_ID in which case the function again attempts an out of bounds access to a local stack array that leads to random crashes or even worse, to memory corruption. Disabled alien gun boats can be captured by infiltrators.

125. **[Fixed]** If defect 65 sets the alien derelict team_type coincidentally to `TEAM_TYPE_COMPUTER` or a decimal value of 2 based on the red_team_clan ini parameter which corresponds to `TEAM_CLAN_CRIMSON_PATH` than an AI function (cseg01:00048D5F) tries to manipulate `AiPlayer_Teams[unit->team]` where the team index is the alien derelict team with a decimal value of 4 while the maximum array index of the AiPlayer_Teams array is three as only four objects are allocated. There is no fifth object for the alien team. This out of bounds access corrupts some other global statically allocated memory contents within the `AiPlayer_ThreatMaps` array which in turn crashes the game whenever the affected threat map objects are attempted to be destructed.

126. **[Fixed]** There is a TaskAttack class method (cseg01:00023755) which issues conditional unit movement orders to move closer to target enemy units if viable. In case the target unit is owned by the alien derelict team, which team does not have heat maps allocated, the algorithm dereferences a null pointer offset by map coordinates which leads to segmentation fault on modern operating systems. The proposed defect fix handles non allocated heat maps as if the heat map would indicate no risks for the pursuer unit.

127. Deploying new unit with either attack or scan range marker enabled renders an incomplete circle. As soon as the screen changes the problem disappears and the newly rendered circle is complete.

128. **[Fixed]** The TaskAttack class has a method (cseg01:0002685E) to determine whether pursued enemy units are within attack range. The TaskKillUnit child tasks could in corner cases be assigned to recently destroyed units in which case the function dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. The proposed defect fix will not garbage collect the completed TaskKillUnit child task here by removing itself as this is surely performed by some other function somewhere else. Instead the affected method will simply report that the non existent target unit does not need to be attacked.

129. The game forgets all previously detected enemy mines on loading a previously saved game. It is assumed that this is not the intended behavior. As an end user I would expect the game to continue from where I left off.

130. In multiplayer games cheaters are supposed to be punished by the game. But enabled cheats are not reset between game sessions. If a cheater starts the game, loads a single player mission, enables a cheat code to see enemy armies, then quits the single player mission and enters a multiplayer game the cheat code is still active without receiving any punishment for the ill gotten advantages. This can be used as an exploit in multiplayer games.

131. The UnitInfo class member `image_index_max` of MK I Infiltrator 6 in training mission 12 (MD5 hash: bfca7a73ad7d2c927b4110f16803d417 \*SAVE12.TRA) is initialized to 0xFFFF or -1 at file offset 0xFD7B. Due to this the walk animation of the infiltrator unit does not work.

132. **[Fixed]** There is a typo in the description of the Mine Layer land unit. "They cannot remove enemy minefields - those most be exploded with gunfire and rockets." -> must be.

133. Land and sea mines do not blow up if enemy units are deployed or activated upon them.

134. **[Fixed]** The TaskCheckAssaults task implements the RemoveUnit (cseg01:0001CB93) interface. The implementation checks whether the passed unit instance is held by a member variable of the task. This task is unique in that it holds a SmartList<UnitInfo> iterator. The RemoveUnit implementation assumes that the iterator is always pointing to a valid ListNode object which seems not to be true. The method dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. This happens most of the time when the player reloads a previously saved game in which case the ongoing game is first cleaned up including the task manager. It is unclear whether the list iterator should never be null by design, thus the proposed defect fix is to simply check whether the iterator is null.

135. Adding a unit to a group by mouse pointer selection or shift + left click prefers ground units in case air and ground units are both present at a grid cell which is counterintuitive.

136. **[Fixed]** It is possible to obtain near infinite speed points for air units moving in groups which could be used as an exploit.

<br>
Even though the unit statistics screen indicates that there are always maximum speed points left after the issue occurs, in reality the `speed` member of the `UnitInfo` class object underflows to -1 which is stored as 0xFF in the `unsigned char` containers. So in fact the player that exploits the issue gains additional 255 speed points to move the affected units around.<br>
The defect is related to group movement of air units and the way euclidean distance is used by air units to move in a straight line ignoring grid cell boundaries. There is a derived member function (cseg01:000B8CCD) of the AirPath class that performs unit movement in a loop until the euclidean distance from destination becomes zero or till group movement speed points run out. Problem is that in corner cases a unit's speed points could become 0 while the group speed is still corresponding to a none zero speed value as another air path related function (cseg01:000B9138) could determine that the target grid distance or movement cost could be bigger than the speed points remaining. In this case the algorithm saves the fraction of speed points left and sets the unit speed to 0 but does not check whether the unit was moving in a group leaving the group speed limit unchanged so the earlier class member function underflows to -1 speed points as it is working on the basis of group speed instead of speed. The proposed defect fix is to change the group speed to the value that corresponds to the speed value of 0 inside the latter function.

137. Most hand crafted missions store incorrect unit counter values in team info structures. This causes summary reports at the end of missions to show incorrect unit statistics. For example campaign mission 3 unit counters indicate that at some point the designers gave the red team 9 armoured personnel carriers and 17 infiltrators before they changed their minds.

138. **[Fixed]** Heat maps are only allocated for teams that are in play (aliens never have heat maps). Unallocated heat maps are set to null. The TaskMove class has a method (cseg01:0004D6E4) that tries to speed up movement of infantry and infiltrator units by using an armoured personnel carrier unless enemy heat maps indicate that the unit to be transported is in danger in which case air transport is attempted. The method checks all enemy heat maps even if they are null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

139. **[Fixed]** The chat / goal button label is wrongly set to chat on loading (cseg01:000D8EB6) any game type that has a set goal if this is the first started game in the game session. Steps to reproduce: start a campaign or training game which creates an autosave in save slot 10. Fully exit the game. Start the game again and load save slot 10. The goal button will print chat until redraw due to mouse hover over or similar event. The root cause is that the saved game loader first initializes the in-game GUI buttons and sets the mission index from the saved file to non zero which would normally set the label of the button to be goal.

140. There is a typo in the campaign mission 5 description. "You land in in an out-of-the-way island." -> You land on an...

141. The hover member of the UnitInfo class member's `flags` bitfield of most air units in campaign mission 5 (09376d9fbd57a1637cb22d09676d61e0 \*SAVE5.CAM) is initialized to 0 which means that the air unit is landed.

By normal means air units cannot land on plain ground. It is assumed that it was not intentional to allow the player to destroy the enemy's only two AWACs right at the beginning of the mission in case of turn based game mode. In simultaneous moves mode the computer has a chance to move the AWACs away before the player could react.

142. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:0001284B) to check whether there is a second selectable unit in a grid cell that does not consider that the used query function (cseg01:000136D8) could return null in which case the earlier function dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

143. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:00087004) to draw a glowing green text box above units on the tactical map in case a research topic or a construction is ready. In case of construction jobs the function receives the builder unit, like an engineer, as function parameter and the parent of the builder unit is set to the newly constructed unit. When an engineer finishes building a connector unit it is automatically deployed by the game without waiting for the player to issue the deployment. Due to this the engineer automatically releases the new unit from being its parent and as such this function dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

144. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:000970AE) to determine the mouse cursor sprite. When a builder unit is the actively selected unit and the unit just finished construction of another unit and the mouse cursor is next to this another unit the cursor is supposed to be set to a certain type. In case the engineer is building connectors in path build mode the builder unit’s parent is set to null in which case the function dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

145. The bottom and right sides of the tactical map have a 1 pixel wide line of corrupted pixels that are not updating correctly when the screen moves.

146. There is a function to set a new mouse cursor shape (cseg01:000C0D94). The function conditionally calls the mouse_hide() and mouse_show() GNW API functions. The GNW API functions copy pixels from the active window surface into the bounds of the newly selected cursor shape to handle transparent cursor pixels. In case the cursor is changed while a new window is being rendered into the window back buffer the monitor screen may still show the old window contents to the player while the game already redrawn part of the contents in the back buffer for the new window. In such corner cases the GNW API functions copy the new unfinished window's already rendered pixels and blits the new cursor with the wrong window background around it to the monitor screen which creates visual glitches until the new window gets fully rendered and blitted to the monitor screen.

147. **[Fixed]** The top right instrument image (`PNLSEQ_5`) is 24 pixels high while all other images in the sequence were 17 pixels only. The respective Window Manager window boundaries are defined to be `{.ulx=384, .uly=0, .lrx=639, .lry=22}`. The bottom pixel row is cropped which effectively cuts the transition part between the shaded and bright window frame area.

148. The scan range of a working constructor is not centered on the unit sprite.

149. Campaign mission 6 and 7 do not end even if the player's victory is obvious. Mission 6 & 7 do not have defined rules to win contrary to most other campaign missions. There is a function (cseg01:0008EFA5) that checks end game conditions. First the loss conditions are tested (cseg01:0008C1BD) which evaluates the enemy to have lost the game already. Then win conditions (cseg01:0008CD4D) are tested and as there are no explicit rules defined the function returns state pending. State pending instead of state generic means that generic rules do not apply thus the algorithm concludes that if the win conditions are pending then the fact that the enemy is utterly destroyed does not matter. After the turns limit ends at 100 turns the game makes a final conclusion that the player has won the game in case of mission 6 while for mission 7 the highest team score wins.

150. In case of (hot seat) multiplayer games if one of the human players cancel landing zone selection with the ESC key while exclusion zones overlap the game progresses the game loop one frame and tries to determine the mouse cursor which is guaranteed to point over the actively selected master builder unit which is (mis)used as the landing zone's exclusion and warning zone markers. As the master builder unit has an IDLE order the cursor selection algorithm (cseg01:00097FB2) assumes that the unit should have a parent which is not true and the game dereferences a null pointer which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

151. **[Fixed]** Two connectors at grid positions 45,70 and 45,71 overlap a depot in campaign mission 8 (MD5 hash: 97379ca828ca8017ea00f728b3b86941 \*SAVE8.CAM) which creates visual glitches. Normally connectors are removed by the game when a building is built over them.

152. Human players are not allowed to move air units to any grid cells where there are visible units of any kind except connectors, roads, water platforms and neutral non selectable units like alien derelicts. Even detected enemy mines are off limits. Air units can overlap with each other via group move or when units run out of speed points. Air units can be moved to cells where there are hidden stealth units. The behavior is counter intuitive and creates various scenarios that result in tactical diadvantages. Proposed design changes:
- Single unit movement: Human players shall be able to move air units to any grid cells, that are not set to blocked by the map for air units, at any time even if the cell is already occupied by any number of other units.
- Single unit movement: Human players shall be able to move land and sea units to any grid cells, that are not set to blocked by the map for ground or sea units, at any time even if the cell is already occupied by any number of air units.
- Single unit selection: Human players shall be able to circulate between all visible, selectable units that are present at a cell by left mouse click.
- Group unit selection (shift + left mouse click): If the group is empty, then select all units of a single class in the given order if present: mobile air, mobile ground, mobile sea. No group selection for stationary units. If the given group is not empty, add all units of already present classes. Maximum group size is 10.
- Group unit selection (left mouse drag shape): Same as shift + left mouse click, but cells from selection are processed one by one from top left to bottom right.
- Load (activate) order in place: Human players shall be able to issue orders to air transporters to load (activate) an eligible mobile land unit from (to) the same cell.
- Enter order in place: Human players shall be able to issue orders to eligible land units to enter an air transporter hovering over the same cell.
- Attack orders in place: Human players shall be able to select which unit to attack in the same cell where the unit is location if there are multiple eligible targets are present.
Quality of life improvements:
- Add icons for the active unit group that allows removal of unit types via clicking on their indicator icons.
- Add popup context menu for grid cell if multiple units are present in the same cell to be able to select the attack target.

153. Campaign missions 2, 5, 9, multiplayer scenario 6, single player scenario 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23 and 24 contain message log entires that should have been removed by the authors. For example in campaign mission 9 red player (MD5 hash: 30a8de876d55f3cabb4bc96f8cb31aab \*SAVE9.CAM) has three logged messages: 1) `Begin turn 1.` 2) `Begin turn 2.` and 3) `Begin turn 2.` yet again. Probably the mission was edited at least twice.

154. **[Fixed]** Computer players evaluate whether their four primary recon unit types have sufficient scan range to avoid enemy fire coming from their targeted enemy team in every turn and request scan unit attribute upgrades if necessary. The algorithm that determines the targeted enemy (cseg01:00066677) loops through all four teams from red to gray and only filters out `TEAM_TYPE_COMPUTER` teams. At any time there are less than four teams in play and the gray team is not human nor computer the algorithm selects gray team, having team type `TEAM_TYPE_NONE` or `TEAM_TYPE_ELIMINATED`, as the targeted enemy even if that team never existed or is already gone. If the red team is human while only the green and blue are computers then the two computers will not attack each other as their arch enemy is set to gray that does not exist. If only two to three computers are in play they will not attack each other. If four computers are in play then red team will select itself as its own targeted enemy team. This effectively means that in many scenarios the computer players do not upgrade their recon units that will be blown to pieces by their enemies due to their limited scan ranges thanks to this defect. This feature was introduced into the game in one of the late patches. The proposed defect fix selects the first team that is not the computer player as targeted enemy and then updates the selection based on which valid enemy type has the highest team points (scrore).

155. **[Fixed]** The AI generates so-called damage potential maps and a minefield map. To determine the damage potential at a given grid cell all possible attack ratings that could hit the cell is summed up. The number of shots that are required to inflict the summed up damage from the attack ratings is also calculated. The armor rating of the friendly unit for which the damage potential map is calculated is used to reduce the damage potential by the number of shots suffered multiplied by the armor rating. The minefield map is taken into consideration by adding plus one shot and the inflicted damage of the mine, reducing the damage total by one shot multiplied by the friendly unit's armor rating. To optimize this time consuming process the AI caches a maximum of 10 previously calculated damage potential maps. The maps are categorized into use cases or unit classes. If a friendly unit needs to calculate the damage potential map and the friendly unit's class is found in the cache, then the only parameter that could be different is the armor rating. There is a function (cseg01:000593E1) to update a damage potential map by the difference in armor ratings between two units of the same class. Unfortunately the given function is defective. The function uses a nested for loop to walk two 2D matrices using pointer arithmetic. In pseudo code the nested loop looks as follows:
```cpp
    for (int grid_x = 0; grid_x < dimension.x; ++grid_x) {
            for (int grid_y = 0; grid_y < dimension.y; ++grid_y) {
                *damage_potential_map[grid_x][0] += shots_map[grid_x][grid_y] * difference;
            }
    }
```
The pseudo code does not use pointer arithmetic for better clarity. Obviously this means that friendly units of the same class with huge armor rating differences will think that they are either near invincible or insufferably vulnerable in the topmost cell row of the tactical map.

156. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:00023EAC) to determine the nearest destination for an attacker that does not require support from a transporter unit. The function attempts to use heat maps to select safe destinations. The alien derelict player does not have heat maps in which case the game dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

157. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:000F49C5) to change the team of a unit. The source team loses sight of its stolen unit depending on the team specific heat maps. When an alien derelict unit is stolen by an infiltrator the source team has no heat maps in which case the game dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

158. Smarter computer players do not destroy alien derelict units instead always attempt to steal them. There is no dedicated task manager task type to infiltrate enemy bases or steal enemy units. The game creates a `TaskKillUnit` type task and assigns an infiltrator as the leader. The below screenshot depicts a corner case where infiltrators are close enough to the target enemy unit, an alien ship, so transporter units cannot be asked for help, and other friendly units participating in the kill unit task as supporters are actually not allowed to attack the alien derelict unit by the “smart” AI, but gather around the kill unit task target regardless. The infiltrator cannot access the grid cell to steal the alien derelict, the supporter units do not know that they are in the way, air transporters are not allowed to move the infiltrator from the near vicinity to the right spot for doing its infiltration business.

This is a good example for a complex soft lock situation.

159. The English in-game help entry for TOPICS_ICONS within the RESEARCH_SETUP group contains a typo. "appropreiate" -> appropriate.

160. The English in-game help entries UPGRADE_1 to UPGRADE_4 within the HANGAR_SETUP group are copy pasted from the repair help menu entries.

161. In case an enemy infiltrator is visible only due to cheat code and the unit stands on a friendly road or similar ground cover class unit, it is not possible to select the enemy infiltrator. It is assumed that cheaters are not intentionally penalized by the game in single player modes, thus the behavior is considered to be a defect.

162. **[Fixed]** The TaskManager class implements a function (cseg01:000453AC) to free up UnitInfo objects for tasks to use. In corner cases, for example when a new mission is started after a previous one is finished and the AI module resets the TaskManager instance, UnitInfo objects reference count tracked by SmartPointers reach zero references eventually within the TaskManager function's body and the raw pointer passed to it is deleted early, thus already freed up memory is getting dereferenced later which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. It is unclear whether the TaskManager or the affected Task derived classes are supposed to protect against early deletions that call the TaskManager API. The proposed defect fix protects against the proven call site which causes segmentation faults, thus protects the called TaskManager API function instead of the caller Task derived class types.

163. **[Fixed]** When a new mission is started after a previous one and the AI module resets the TaskManager instance, tasks of type TaskRemoveMines attempt to check the map surface via an Access module function (cseg01:00013CFD) after the mission start-up code already deleted the map object as part of its reinitialization sequence. The function does not check whether the map object is valid which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. It is difficult to tell what would be the appropriate way to initialize, reinitialize and uninitialize all the game assets and game objects, thus the defect fix does not attempt to fix the architecture design of the original game. Instead a simple defect fix is proposed that simply tests for null pointer within the Access module function that caused the detected segmentation fault.

164. **[Fixed]** The TaskCreateBuilding class implements a method (cseg01:0002E07B) to finish build jobs. In corner cases the last SmartPointer reference to the task object itself gets removed and the object is prematurely deleted during the execution of another class virtual method (cseg01:0002CF2C). When the earlier method gets back control and tries to use object specific member variables that hold UnitInfo object references there is a chance that the already freed up heap memory is already reallocated for something else and a new corrupted activation order is issued based on garbage data. In other cases invalid memory addresses could be dereferenced which leads to segmentation faults on modern systems. This defect may be related to defect 12.

165. **[Fixed]** The task debugger class implements a scrollable list window. The scroll up and down buttons do not update the button disabled state sprites correctly on reaching list boundaries as the buttons do not register mouse press release event handlers in the class constructor (cseg01:000E02BC).

166. **[Fixed]** The save / load menu implements save slot panels as class objects that instantiate local pixel buffers where an image, and a text edit control writes data. The save slot object destructor deletes the image control first, than the local pixel buffers and finally the text edit control. The problem with this call sequence is that image and text edit controls restore original background data buffered by the controls to their earlier target buffer areas. As the local pixel buffer is already deleted when the text edit control tries to copy its cached data there memory corruption or segmentation fault occurs. The two pixel buffers must be deleted after the image and text edit control object by the applicable class member function (cseg01:000D6AD6).

167. **[Fixed]** Each popup context menu button registers an event handler function. Each event handler calls a function (cseg01:0009448C) to destruct the popup buttons that invoked them. This is wrong as the button control object calls the event handler function that deletes the button control object and after the event handler function returns to the button control object manager function () it dereferences and writes to already released heap memory which could lead to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

168. **[Fixed]** The game registers a screenshot saver function (cseg01:00091AB9) which produces images in indexed PCX format. The format uses RLE encoding of maximum 63 pixels long strides. The original implementation compares two consecutive pixels in the buffer for equality and tests whether the stride is longer than the buffer limits after. This leads to out of bounds read access and in corner cases this leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. The conditional tests shall be reordered so that the buffer limits are tested first and consecutive pixel equality only after.

169. **[Fixed]** The TaskManageBuildings task periodically evaluates whether to build a storage unit. If the stored cargo in the relevant complex is more than 75% of the capacity available and planned in the complex, then a new storage unit is ordered. The algorithm considers planned mining stations in the capacity figure. A planned mining station could be waiting for constructors to become available, the available constructor could be waiting for water platforms to be built at the planned location, a water platform to be built could be waiting for an engineer to arrive at the target location, and finally an engineer could be waiting for raw materials to become available. This could lead to situations where computer players are losing all of their raw material production for dozens of turns. The proposed defect fix is to ignore mining stations under construction in the raw materials capacity level if the overall team capacity is below a threshold and to request capacity increase until a minimum threshold level could be satisfied.

170. The TaskCreateBuilding task evaluates whether boardwalks are required to be built around newly ordered buildings. The relevant algorithm (cseg01:0002ED2B) first generates an access map for land units, then evaluates the map and decides where to request the construction of new bridges. The map excludes all non desired grid cells like dangerous locations, locations with existing or planned non passable buildings, and locations with abundant resources. The map also identifies all locations where bridges are already present or their construction is planned. Finally if grid cells are identified around the newly ordered building where bridges could be built, they are ordered. The only problem is that water platforms are passable buildings that cannot be replaced by bridges by engineers and this is not considered by the algorithm. So the algorithm could order the construction of new bridges at locations where water platforms or even roads or land mines are already present or where water platforms are already planned to be built.

171. **[Fixed]** There is a typo in the German translation: `OK, Datei zu speichern \n%s\"5s\"` > `OK, Datei zu speichern \n%s\"%s\"`.

172. **[Fixed]** There is a typo in the French translation: `\n(%i Mat.` > `\n(%i Mat.)`.

173. **[Fixed]** There is a typo in the French translation. Original English: `Reaction Fire Off`. Translation: `Auto-Tirer` > `En repos`.

174. **[Fixed]** The German translation did not translate two multiplayer relevant messages: `Cheater!` and `Cheater! Prepare to pay the price.`.

175. **[Fixed]** There is a typo in the Italian translation: `Materie Prime: %s: ` > `Materie Prime: %s`.

176. **[Fixed]** Most translations forgot to update the game executable name to the retail one: `\nTo play M.A.X. type MC\n\n` > `\nTo play M.A.X. type MAX\n\n`.

177. **[Fixed]** There is a function to draw text on the save / load menu into save slots (cseg01:000D7754). The function center aligns strings horizontally and vertically. The horizontal alignment part does not consider that long strings would result in a negative or below minimum positive horizontal position offset shifting strings to the left, while the long strings themselves are truncated by GNW's text blitter (cseg01:0010A320). The issue is most apparent in the Italian translation.

178. The planet selection menu can render maximum 5 rows of text to describe planets. Some of the translations, e.g. the Italian translation for Planet Frigia, does not fit into the available text box area and description is truncated.

179. **[Fixed]** The TaskKillUnit class implements a method (cseg01:0001B638) to find unit types that can attack the task target. The method generates a weight table which could contain invalid entries with their unit_type member set to INVALID_ID and their weight member set to 0. The entires are iterated through twice by the method. The first iteration filters out the invalid entires by their weight being set to 0. The second iteration fails to do this and uses INVALID_ID to dereference a BaseUnit array element which is out of bounds access that leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.

180. **[Fixed]** The TaskFrontalAttack class implements a method (cseg01:0001F76B) to issue new orders for managed units. The method conditionally checks a team specific heat map which is created at game startup. During game cleanup the heat maps may already be destroyed when the AI module clears out the task manager tasks in which case the given method may dereference a null pointer which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. Two call sites are affected by this issue.

181. **[Fixed]** There is a function to draw life production and consumption statistics (cseg01:000A0448) and another one to draw power production and consumption statistics (cseg01:000A01F8). There is a corner case when these functions draw incorrect values. The upgrade all command changes the unit order of all affected units to `ORDER_UPGRADE`. When the game processes unit orders and the actively selected unit is getting upgraded the unit statistics area on the GUI is refreshed. The unit upgrade method restores the original order that the unit had before getting the upgrade order so individual unit specific attributes are not affected by this issue. But as many other units could still be waiting to be upgraded at the time their orders could still be set to `ORDER_UPGRADE`. The two functions iterate through all team units to determine total sum of life or power production and count all units that have orders like `ORDER_POWER_ON`. These calculations will ignore all units that have the upgrade orders instead of the usual power on or similar ones. When the player selects another similar unit the production and consumption sums are calculated correctly again as in the meantime all upgrades finish and unit orders are restored.

182. **[Fixed]** Fixing defect 155 revealed other latent conceptual issues with the way damage potential and shots maps are managed by computer players. The below image depicts the access map of a computer player. The green zones are not accessible due to terrain objects or too high damage potential of defending enemy units. The red zones indicate how M.A.X. v1.04 blocked additional areas due to defect 155. The white glow in the red line found in the first map row indicates the aggregated armor rating compensation that should have been applied to the entire map, not only to the first row of it. The only problem is that now that armor is correctly compensated, the rest of the threat map algorithm is not behaving as expected anymore. Now if weak friendly units gather around and then enter into the red zone around the green no-go zone of the enemy defenses, they are immediately destroyed. It seems that the original authors, not knowing about defect 155, designed the rest of the relevant algorithms in a way that the resulting behavior would feel convincing for the human players even if the thought process behind it is somewhat flawed.
<br>

<br>
<br>
A simplified example: There is an enemy gun turret with attack rating of 16 and 2 shots. There is an enemy scout that could move in range which has an attack rating of 12 and 1 shot. The minefield map has no information available which means 1 shot with 0 attack rating. The enemy damage potential in this case is 44 damage and 4 shots at friendly armor rating of 0. A friendly scout stands at the beginning of the turn at the edge of the gun turrent’s attack range. The scout considers a non aggressive move at caution level 3 (no damage allowed in the current turn). The scout’s attack rating is 12, has 1 shot, an attack range of 3 and its armor rating is 4. The scout’s defense potential is subtracted from the enemies’ damage potential within the scout’s limited range : 44 - 1 * 12 = 32. In addition the damage potential map is updated from armor rating 0 to 4 at which time the 4 enemy shots are compensated by 4 * 4 = 16 armor and the result is subtracted from the remaining damage potential of the enemy so 32 - 16 = 16. A single scout reduced the enemy’s attack potential by 28 damage in the most paranoid scenario with caution level of 3. The scout will not attack as remaining damage potential is still > 0. But what if a second friendly scout would stand near the other in the beginning of the same turn? That would be sufficient now to convince one or both of the friendly scouts to move within range of the gun turret which will immediately destroy one of them.
<br>
<br>
The proposed defect fix improves the following corner cases:
- The function (cseg01:000612CD) that calculates and caches threat map objects considers minefield maps for most risk classes except class 2 (surveyors) and 3 (air units). If the minefield map exists one additional shot is added to each grid cell within the shots map even if the minefield map already marked the grid cell with a damage potential of -1 for being safe, or when the minefield map does not have any information about a zone and sets the damage potential to 0 for relevant grid cells. This effectively means, now that defect 155 is fixed, that when the armor rating of a friendly unit is applied to a threat map object's damage potential map the armor rating is considered one additional time due to the additional shot in the shots map.
- Threat maps are generated on demand and cached maps are invalidated at the beginning of the next turn. Spotted enemy units are major factors during the generation of these maps and if a map for a given unit class is already cached, newly spotted enemy units during the turn will not be considered by computer players. Now that modern hardware has much more computational power compared to a personal computer from 1996 much more tasks could be fully processed by computer players within a single turn and this could mean that enemy units are one after the other go and get massacred until the next turn begins and the computer realizes that there are newly identified threats.
- If the game setting is enabled, then units of computer players also interrupt their ongoing movements when they detect new threats (emergency stop). But due to the previous point if they request a new safe path to be generated they will probably not get the requested safe path as the threat map is potentially cached in which case the newly spotted enemy will not be considered by the path generator till the next turn begins.
It is another interesting question whether it is a good idea at all to stop unit movement in every scenario. What if the moving unit which spotted a high range turret will get destroyed just because it stopped before reaching the originally planned end point that may have been a safe spot?<br><br>

183. The units renderer uses a hash map to optimize enumeration of units within given map boundaries. The hash map could become corrupted in corner cases. Root cause is not known yet. Due to the defect it could happen that a unit is unintentionally removed from the hash map, or a unit that is typically destroyed could be misplaced in the hash map. These hash map corruptions could cause visual glitches or game logic issues. The corruption is saved into saved game files, making the issue persistent between game sessions.

184. **[Fixed]** As documented in defect 158 smarter computer players normally do not destroy alien derelict units instead attempt to steal them. There is a function (cseg01:00018266) that determines which spotted enemy unit to attack by units controlled by for example a `TaskKillUnit` type task next. When the function evaluates a friendly unit that is an infiltrator it is checked whether the infiltrator has at least 85% chance to disable the enemy to proceed with further considerations. In case a rookie infiltrator wants to steal a disabled alien derelict unit there is a high chance that the chance to disable the actually already disabled unit would be determined to be below 85% which forbids the infiltrators to act in a situation where there is no critical failure scenario. Furthermore alien units are considered to be high value assets so computer players will prefer them as targets even if `TaskKillUnit` controlled friendly units cannot attack them in case the computer player is expert difficulty level or tougher. This creates situations where computer player units would gather around disabled alien derelicts to do nothing when they arrive at these sites. This behavior cripples smarter computer players when the alien derelicts feature is enabled.
<br>
Proposed defect fix:
- Stealth action of an infiltrator should not be prohibited due to chance to success ratios when the target unit is already disabled.
- `TaskAttack` tasks should not be created at all to target alien derelicts at expert or tougher difficulty levels while the team does not have infiltrators available as other units are not allowed to attack them anyways.<br><br>

185. There are several units that reach above 255 hit points when they are fully developed. The game stores unit hits as `unsigned char` which can only hold values between 0 - 255. To fix this limitation the save file format version needs to be updated.

186. **[Fixed]** The TaskDump task has a member function (cseg01:0005032F) to check whether a unit is in its own control and if so remove it and eventually the task itself from the task manager as the task has no more use after it has no unit to dump. In corner cases the function could dereference null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. A TaskDump task cannot be created without a valid TaskMove task, but evidence shows that due to defect 209 the managed unit as well as the TaskMove task could be set to nullptr without destroying the TaskDump task itself. The proposed defect fix is to make the member function less error prone by testing for the invalid use case where the TaskMove object could be null.

187. **[Fixed]** The TaskManageBuildings manager task is responsible to request connectors that connect up buildings and complexes. At the beginning of the process the task searches for a friendly building, preferably a mining station, that could be used as the destination point for other buildings to connect to. Other buildings of the given team then look for access to the destination point. The search algorithm tests connectability to the north, east, south and west directions from each evaluated building.

The above screenshot depicts a corner case where the first mining station found in the manager's buildings list is inside an isolated area. The mining station is marked with a red circle. The mountains around the mining station block off the line of sight, which is indicated for the power station with green rectangles in the direction of the destination point, of other buildings that seek connection indicated by the red demarcation lines. Due to this none of the complexes could be connected up to the chosen destination point and as new buildings in the list are pushed to the back of the list the given computer player is basically broken in the given game until the isolated mining station gets destroyed.
The proposed defect fix is a very basic one. Instead of preferring the first mining station, prefer any mining station that is in a bigger complex than the previous selection. This approach does not solve problems in various other corner cases, but potentially improves the behavior in the given corner case at least. A more appropriate long term fix would be to replace the current algorithm with a more capable one that identifies continents first and complexes on them and attempts to generate connector systems that are not limited to line of sight.

188. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:00010010) that contributes to resolving ground path related corner cases. The last parameter to the function determines whether to elevate or lower a bridge when conditions allow the move. The parameter was always selecting elevation of the bridge even if lowering would have been more appropriate. The related assembler code is very suspicious indicating a defect.
```nasm
mov     eax, [ebp+unitinfo_object]
mov     al, byte ptr [eax+UnitInfoObject.flags] ; move LSB flags to al: GROUND_COVER|EXPLODING|ANIMATED|CONNECTOR_UNIT|BUILDING|MISSILE_UNIT|MOBILE_AIR_UNIT|MOBILE_SEA_UNIT
and     al, 0 ; ignore all flags we just read from the UnitInfo object. Why ???
and     eax, 0FFh
push    eax ; function argument is always 0 (false or elevation mode)
```

<br>
<br>
In the demonstrated scenario a hidden enemy submarine with available speed or movement points is standing under the bridge south from the rocket launcher. When the rocket launcher wants to move onto the bridge the submarine side steps to prevent detection which means that the bridge should not be elevated anymore. The rocket launcher's ground path object detects that the bridge is elevated and there are no other units in the way so instructs the bridge to do something. Due to the defect the bridge can only get a move order to get elevated again while obviously the bridge should be lowered so that the rocket launcher can pass it. If the elevation order finishes for the bridge the bridge gets an await order which is responsible to monitor whether the bridge could be lowered. But the rocket launcher that is not admitting that it is blocked bombards the bridge in every decision making cycle to elevate which overrides the bridge's await order which would realize that there is no need to be elevated. This is a deadlock situation. The path object of the rocket launcher became a babbling idiot that prevented the bridge from working properly. The video also shows that this situation prevents finishing the game turn even after the turn timer reaches 0 seconds. The proposed defect fix changes the GroundPath method (cseg01:000BA570) behavior with the strange assembly that always calls the previously mentioned function in elevation mode. The new behavior prefers lowering the bridge in case the unit that wants to move over the bridge is not a `MOBILE_SEA_UNIT`. This does not prevent the bridge from being elevated if something is actually standing under it.

189. **[Fixed]** The TaskDump task has a member function (cseg01:00050383) to search for accessible, safe drop off spots for transporters. The algorithm searches in an increasing radius around a destination in counter clockwise direction. Problem is that after each full round the starting point of the next rectangle is supposed to be moved one cell to left, up or `Point(-1,+1)` to increase the radius in a way that the mid point remains the destination. This algorithm fails to do this which means that it always searches only in the direction of sount east and even in that direction the algorithm skips a lot of grid cells in every round.

190. **[Fixed]** The TaskTransport task is allowed to request air transport for an infiltrator in case a previously selected armoured personnel carrier gets blocked on the way to pick up the passenger. Problem is that the request to use air transport is made from the blocked TaskMove task's finished move callback interface which is not designed for such control flows. At the time when the new transporter is requested the previous request is not finished cleaning up after itself. The new request basically corrupts the TaskMove task's object state and when the first request can finally resume to finish the clean up in the callback it dereferences null which leads to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. The proposed defect fix removes the request to use air transport within the clean up code of a blocked armoured personnel carrier's transport request (cseg01:0004C66B). This eliminates the identified control flow issues on the expense that the infiltrator may need to make a transport request at a later time on its own.

191. **[Fixed]** The path searcher class allocates a vector in its constructor (cseg01:000BBFBF) to hold the ideal path costs. The algorithm optimizes the size of the vector, but in corner cases out of bounds access could occur as array size plus one element could be addressed.

192. **[Fixed]** When an air unit is activated from (cseg01:000FFC49) a hangar with 0 speed points the following events take place normally. The unit gets an activate order. If the unit is an air unit it can be activated regardless of whether there is a free spot around the hangar as air units can stack. At this point the hangar removes the air unit from its register and issues a move order for the unit. The move order gets preempted by an expand order. When the expand order finishes the move order continues, but it finds that the unit is not hovering thus a take off order is issued which preempts the move order. The take off succeeds regardless if the air unit has no speed points left. After the successful take off the unit continues with the move order again and finally it finds that the unit has 0 speed points left and pauses the movement order’s normal state flow. At this point the hangar does not register the unit, the expansion and take off finished, but the unit cannot move from the previous spot, which was the hangar, thus the map hash is not updated and the unit cannot be rendered as visible for the player. Basically the unit can only be found in the air units master list. The next turn the move order continues and the unit becomes visible again, unless the player selects the unit via the Reports menu while it is invisible and issues a different order. The proposed solution to prevent the described anomaly is to prevent air units to be activated with 0 speed points. This change also ensures that the unit will not exist in a state where it is not in the hash map. In multiplayer games, at least in hot seat games, the defect could also be used as a weak exploit.

193. **[Fixed]** The repair shop class constructor (cseg01:00081F02) creates instances of repair shop slots. Each slot has a button instance for repair, activate, reload and upgrade events. The constructor sets button state to enabled or disabled before it would register the buttons for the parent window. Due to this the disabled buttons remain enabled and clickable.

194. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:0009D045) to populate maps with batches of concentrated resources. The function validates the team specific landing spots and could determine that the spots are not ideal and could move them around in a short radius within the scope of the given function. After the ideal landing spot is determined locally, without updating the team's actual landing spot itself, the function makes it sure that the minimum acceptable levels for fuel and raw materials are present at the locally determined landing spot based on the `INI_MAX_RESOURCES` ini configuration setting. There is a function (cseg01:000A1A26) to determine where to place the initial mining station of a team. The function takes a predetermined landing spot that is assumed to be on a viable continent outside enemy proximity zones and then checks whether the location is truly valid and could support the initial mining station with sufficient fuel and raw materials. The minimum acceptable levels for fuel and raw materials are determined for the initial location based on the `INI_MAX_RESOURCES` ini configuration setting. If any of the requirements are not met then the function seeks for a viable new location within a hard coded radius of 10 grid cells, presumed to be still outside of enemy danger zones, and the function assumes that a location is guaranteed to be found. One identified issue is that while the initial location is tested against minimum fuel and raw materials limits that are determined based on `INI_MAX_RESOURCES`, the other locations within the 10 grid cells radius are tested against hard coded limits of 8 fuel and 12 raw materials. In case the first referred function moves the ideal landing spot around locally and sets up minimum resource levels there, and the second referred function tests against not the granted minimum resource levels starting from the second iteration loop, but the hard coded ones, there is a high chance that no viable spot will be found. As the video clip demonstrates, if no viable landing spot is found it becomes possible to deploy teams to any location including the edge of the map or directly onto the sea or where there are no resources under the initial mining station whatsoever. A further disadvantage for teams that are deployed onto the sea is that their land units could be deployed far away onto actual land even right next to an enemy team. Finally the test radius is hard coded to 10 grid cells while `INI_EXCLUDE_RANGE` and `INI_PROXIMITY_RANGE` are configurable.

<br>
The proposed defect fix is to use `INI_MAX_RESOURCES (20)` consistently throughout relevant functions and to move the predetermined landing spot to where the expected minimum resource levels are granted by the algorithm that populates resources onto the map.

195. **[Fixed]** The path transcriber algorithm (cseg01:000BCE26) conditionally stops the copy operation if a path cost limit is reached. The movement cost associated to a grid cell is multiplied by a factor of 3/2 in case of diagonal movement steps. The algorithm tests whether a movement step is diagonal in an incorrect way. Instead of testing the overall path taken, the step offset shall be used to determine whether a step is diagonal. In corner cases the issue could truncate valid paths due to incorrectly high summarized costs.

196. **[Fixed]** A bulldozer removes any number of small rubbles from a single cell in a single turn. A bulldozer removes a large rubble in four turns. If a small rubble and a large rubble overlap at the grid cell where the bulldozer is standing before the clearing operation there is no option to remove only the small rubble or the large rubble, both are removed in four turns. If there are small rubbles overlapping with the large rubble the bulldozer will not remove any of the small rubbles from cells where the bulldozer was not standing at before starting the clearing process. This behavior is unintuitive. Expected behavior: any rubble that is overlapping with the large rubble shall be removed over the four turns clearing operation.

197. **[Fixed]** Build menus calculate the material costs at X1, X2 and X4 rates. The material cost per turn depends on the manufacturing unit or facility and the manufacturing rate multiplier. For example an Air Units Plant at X4 rate consumes 36 raw materials to decrease the turns to build counter by 4 increments while an Engineer at X4 rate only consumes 24 raw materials. The overall raw materials cost to produce a unit depends on the number of turns the unit takes to be built at base X1 rate. For example it takes 12 turns to build a Mining Station at X1 rate. At X4 rate a Constructor would need 12 per 4 times 24 raw materials to finish in 3 turns, but a Constructor cannot hold 72 raw materials. Thus the Constructor would run at X4 rate for 1 turn (1 \* 24 raw materials), and would continue at X2 rate for 4 additional turns (4 \* 8 raw materials) ending up at a 5 turns total for 24 + 32 = 56 raw materials. There is a function A (cseg01:00011E00) to determine the raw materials costs per turn for a manufacturing unit operating at a given rate, there is a function B (cseg01:00074C69) to calculate the total turns to build a unit at a requested manufacturing rate from available raw materials, and finally there is a function C (cseg01:000F4F88) to determine the maximum feasible manufacturing rate and turns remaining till completion for an ongoing build operation. The algorithm of Function B is defective in corner cases and in certain scenarios. Function A, B and C are used in different scenarios in different ways and one use case could behave correctly while another misbehaves. One of the many defective scenarios is as follows. To construct a Barracks at X4 rate 26 raw materials are required and the operation takes 2 turns for a Constructor. 1 turn at X4 rate for 24 raw materials and one more turn at X1 rate for 2 raw materials. If the Constructor has the exact amount required, the 26 raw materials, the build menu disables the X4 manufacturing rate button in the GUI incorrectly as function B's algorithm is wrong in the given use case scenario. If the constructor has more raw materials and the operation can be performed at X4 rate at completion exactly 26 raw materials are consumed. Function C depends on function A and B. Function B depends on function A. Function A does not depend on any other function. The expected behavior is that the relevant algorithms are always able to determine the maximum manufacturing rate that is possible to use based on the limited available resources and at the same time the turns determined to be required to build the unit is always the fastest and most cost effective.

198. **[Fixed]** The pass table of Sanctuary (MD5 hash: a1ea35f902360b093d154218e51a34dd \*GREEN_4.WRL) marks tile 190 as `Blocked` while based on the tile art it should be `passable land`. The map only uses the tile once at grid cell position \[002,006\]. The proposed defect fix patches the map data on load which means that existing saved games are not affected.

199. **[Fixed]** If multiple rubbles are located at the location that is cleared up by a bulldozer, their recoverable raw materials are not summed up even though all of the rubbles are removed in the process. Which rubble's materials are recovered only depends on their place within the hash map which is somewhat unpredictable. Expected behavior is to recover all materials from all removed rubbles.

200. **[Fixed]** In the corner case depicted by the below screenshot a computer player was hit by a devastating enemy attack streak. The computer player's main complex is cut in half and there is a lot of rubble between the two segments of the old main complex. The buildings manager task issued more than six connectors to be built and assigned all four available engineers to these important tasks. The TaskCreateBuilding tasks assigned to build the connectors realized that there were rubbles at the build sites and each of these tasks created child tasks requesting the removal of the rubble by a bulldozer. As there is no bulldozer available, one is requested to be built as a child task. But the light vehicle plants are unable to operate as one of them does not have access to fuel, while the other does not have access to a power source. The connectors would be required. Fortunately, connectors can be built above rubble so the engineers just need to issue a move order to reach the targeted build sites. But the TaskCreateBuilding task has a member function (cseg01:0002FCC6) that handles the operating states of build operations and if the build task has at least one child task assigned, then builders are not allowed to issue move orders if they are in the close vicinity of the build site already. Summary: connectors cannot be built as builders cannot enter the build sites as bulldozing is requested. Bulldozers cannot be built as all engineers are waiting to be allowed to build connectors.
<br>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/defect_200.png" alt="defect 200" width="740">
<br>
This is a good example for a complex soft lock situation. The proposed defect fix is to allow entry to the build site if the first child task is rubble removal and the unit to be built is a connector.

201. **[Fixed]** The `TaskUpgrade` derived class issues an `ORDER_UPGRADE` in `ORDER_STATE_INIT` state to an eligible unit if the relevant complex has at least 1 raw material. When the upgrade order is processed and it is found that there is insufficient raw materials to do the actual upgrade the respective function (cseg01:000F2125) unconditionally restores the operator unit's previous order and order state, but does not remove the upgrade task from the target unit and schedules a high priority task reminder for the unfinished `TaskUpgrade` task. Before a team's turn is allowed to end all priority reminders must be concluded. The previously noted task reminder calls one of the virtual functions (cseg01:0006C085) of the task type which finds that the upgrade did not happen, an operator is selected though and the unit to be upgraded is also defined, thus the upgrade operation is qualified for a retry if the complex has at least 1 raw material. This effectively creates an endless loop which could be escaped in very rare corner cases. The endless loop is observable by the end user as a `00:00` turn timer issue. Proposed defect fix: the endless loop should be broken if the upgrade operation fails by issuing a non high priority task reminder instead of a high priority one.

202. **[Fixed]** The below screenshot depicts a corner case where the computer player is unable to perform any construction or manufacturing job.
<br>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/defect_202.png" alt="defect 202" width="740"> 
<br>
 The gray team's only complex has a single mining station that holds the maximum 25 raw materials, a fuel tank that is empty and a gold vault that is also empty. The mining station can produce 16 materials per turn and it has 9 fuel, 14 raw materials and 1 gold available for mining. The gray team has 1 constructor with minimal raw materials held, and two engineers that are nearly empty. The constructor is assigned a job to build a light vehicle plant. The gray team's mining station is configured to produce 2 fuels and 14 raw materials per turn.
In the given situation the following AI behaviors prevent any construction or manufacturing operations:
- The constructor cannot start to build the plant as it needs more raw materials. The associated `CreateBuildingTask` is waiting for materials, but as the team already has a light vehicle plant the operation is not priority in which case the task checks (cseg01:0002FA3B) whether there would be sufficient materials to operate the desired building in the future first. If the new building would consume power, the team should have at least 10 fuel reserves otherwise the operation is blocked. The team has no fuel reserves at all so the construction is blocked. The condition is error prone as there is no guarantee that the future complex would have the desired fuel reserves.
- In theory the two existing factories of the team could build something useful, but to be allowed to build anything the `TaskCreateUnit` task requires some preconditions (cseg01:00038CC9) to be fulfilled as well. To operate a factory the building would need power for which we need to provide fuel. If the team does not have at least 10 fuel reserves the team's complexes are inspected to see whether there are sufficient material sources available or whether some non vitally important buildings, namely gold refineries or Eco-spheres, could be shut down. The team has a single mining station but with fuel reserves below 10 fuel the team would need 5 of them and there are no non vitally important buildings to decrease this level. If the level is above a threshold of 3, the factories are not allowed to start new unit production tasks.
- The `TaskManageBuildings` task assesses whether new storage units, fuel tanks or gold vaults are needed. If material reserves are lower than 75% of storage capacity, then no new units are ordered. The manager considers not only existing, but also planned buildings in the metrics. The team has a single mining station that is full and there is at least one more mining station already planned to be built that is obviously empty. 25 raw materials stored while capacity is 50 means a fill rate of 50% only so new storage units cannot be built even though the team loses every newly mined raw materials each turn. See defect 169.
- The `TaskManageBuildings` task assesses at the beginning of each turn whether more mining stations are required to satisfy materials supply demand (cseg01:0003497A). Fuel production gets top priority and there is a base demand of 5 fuels. All buildings increase the fuel demand by their rated fuel consumption. The gray team has 3 power generators and one power station which means a total fuel demand of 3 \* 2 + 1 \*6 + 5 = 17. If any fuel tanks would hold some reserves, 10% of those reserves would be subtracted from the demand, but there is none. If there would be new fuel consumer buildings already in production, their demand would be considered too, but there are no such ongoing operations. Next, each existing and already planned mining stations' production capabilities are assessed. If all fuel demand could be satisfied this way, new mining stations will not be requested to be built. Requesting new mining stations would not make any difference anyways as the only constructor is busy and the heavy vehicle plant is not allowed to produce new ones.
- The `ProductionManager` optimizes all mining operations for actual demand ignoring free storage capacity levels. As only a single power generator operates, two fuels are configured to be produced.

     This is a good example for a complex soft lock situation. The computer does not priorize fuel production to prevent wasting mined resources and all productions and constructions are halted as there are less than 10 fuel reserves in store.

     The proposed defect fix is to at least let factories build units in case there is nothing to power off, but there is plenty of raw materials in store while there are no fuel reserves even if mining capacity would allow production.

203. In corner cases the production manager cannot restart mining operations. For example if the initial mining station allocates 0 fuel and 0 raw material production and stops the mining station as well as the initial power generator, it is impossible to start either building anymore. Expected behavior: in the given corner case the production manager shall be able to increase fuel production without decreasing another material type production as there is free production capacity available.

204. **[Fixed]** The TaskManager implements a function (cseg01:00045466) to search new tasks for units that have no tasks. Typically if units process all of their tasks a unit available reminder is scheduled for them for the TaskManager. The search function verifies whether a unit is destroyed by testing its hit points against 0. A unit in order state `ORDER_STATE_STORE` in general is loaded into a building or a transporter or just finished construction. Therefore the search function rightfully assumes that if the unit is in the given order state, then it must have a parent unit. In corner cases the parent does not exist and a NULL pointer dereference occurs and on modern operating systems this causes a segmentation fault and the game crashes immediately.
If a unit is loaded and its container is destroyed, all of the container's units are destroyed, but their order, order state and hit points are not changed as such units do not explode. Their parent is set to NULL though. Normally all references to the held units are unlinked and the unit object gets deleted, but in corner cases, for example when a unit available reminder is scheduled for the destroyed unit, the search function could receive a unit in order state `ORDER_STATE_STORE` and without a parent unit set. The proposed defect fix is to set the hit points of all destroyed units to 0. Destroying a unit also removes it from hash maps, thus this defect could be relevant for defect 183.

205. **[Fixed]** The TaskCreateBuilding task tests whether the requested building is still needed by its parent task and if the answer is no for whatever reason, the TaskCreateBuilding task is aborted. There are several other situations where a request could be aborted by the TaskCreateBuilding task itself too. Aborting a TaskCreateBuilding task sets its parent, manager, zone to clear out, builder unit and an already spawned new unit to NULL. Normally the task is removed from the TaskManager and the task’s own buildings manager and the task gets deleted, but in certain corner cases a turn end reminder could be scheduled while the abort request is processed which keeps alive the aborted task and one of its member functions (cseg01:0002D901) could be executed which will find that the task does not have a builder assigned, so it requests a new one by issuing a TaskObtainUnits task and this could lead to the actual construction of the requested unit type by an eligible constructor regardless of the abort request. The constructor processes the order, finishes the job, but as the already aborted TaskCreateBuilding has no buildings manager assigned and the TaskCreateBuilding is actually not scheduled by the TaskManager either, there is no way to activate the constructor that finished the construction. The proposed defect fix is to set the requested building type of aborted TaskCreateBuilding tasks to `INVALID_ID` which eventually makes it impossible to build an aborted unit.

206. The TaskDefenseReserve task implements a method (cseg01:0001E8C5) that iterates over mobile sea and land units and filters down the list to units that have the `BUILDING` property. Obviously none of them will have it which makes a huge portion of the method dead code. The bit mask of `BUILDING` is 0x10 while the bit mask of `MOBILE_LAND_UNIT` is 0x100. The filtered list of units would be sorted into two groups, units adjacent to water and units in land. Each groups' assets are summed up and compared against the enemy's air assets in a way to match the enemy assets' worth when the two groups are combined. Each group selects their preferred units, mostly land or sea unit types that would be reserved for defense related activities. It is assumed that the `BUILDING` filter mask is a typo. As a side effect of this defect computer players are unable to request existing or new units to defend themselves against enemy air units. Defect 92 has a further negative effect on the related computer behavior.

207. **[Fixed]** The units manager implements a function (cseg01:00102CB8) to process unit orders. If a unit is assigned an `ORDER_FIRE` order starting at order state `ORDER_STATE_INIT` the unit is queued for later order execution in FIFO order within the given function. While processing of the unit order is basically pending the given unit could be hit by enemy fire which changes the units current order to `ORDER_EXPLODE`. The given function does not check what is the current unit order when it gets the next unit having assumed fire order to be processed in FIFO order and the fire order state of the unit is updated while it has `ORDER_EXPLODE`. This effectively breaks the explode order state machine and as a game turn cannot end while a unit is in the exploding transitional state, the game enters into an endless loop. In select cases the defect could consistently reoccur after reloading a previously saved game rendering the given saved game completely useless. The proposed defect fix is to verify that the unit has fire order when the queued fire order of a unit is processed from the aforementioned queue.

208. **[Fixed]** In corner cases a TaskFindPath task could indicate to its parent TaskMove task that the path is blocked by another friendly unit. In such cases the TaskMove task may request the waypoint or final destination to be cleared out by a TaskClearZone task (cseg01:0004F587). If a RemindMoveFinished task reminder is scheduled at the time and the parent task of the TaskMove task, a TaskFrontalAttack task, configured the TaskMove task to handle the request as non essential (cseg01:0001F76B), and clearing out the zone turns out to be unsuccessful only after the RemindMoveFinished reminder executes and requests a new TaskFindPath child task to be executed (cseg01:0004E0CC), then the TaskMove task could be canceled and deinitialized by the TaskClearZone task which means that the TaskFindPath child task will dereference null pointers in the parent TaskMove task object which leads to out of bounds read and write accesses under DOS systems that lead to segmentation faults on modern operating systems. The described phenomenon is basically a race condition between subtasks of TaskMove so the proposed defect fix is to block new TaskFindPath child task requests while a Zone object is owned by the TaskMove task.

209. **[Fixed]** The TaskAttack task periodically assesses (cseg01:000269A3) which enemy units protect its primary target(s). If an enemy unit turns out not to be a threat anymore for the attack mission, the associated TaskKillUnit task is canceled (cseg01:00025199) and all friendly units allocated to the TaskKillUnit task are made available for the task manager to be used for something else (cseg01:0001C800). This means that all tasks assigned to such friendly units are notified that they must release the affected friendly unit(s). In corner cases a TaskMove task could be canceled (cseg01:0004FF84) due to such an event while the TaskMove task is using a transporter unit to speed up the friendly unit’s movement. To use a transporter a TaskMove task could instantiate a TaskTransport task that may instantiate a TaskMove task for the transporter unit to move it around. In case the transporter unit’s TaskMove task concludes for whatever reason and the friendly unit to be transported was picked up it should be dumped by the transporter unit somewhere for which the TaskTransport task instantiates a TaskDump task and passes it the friendly unit’s TaskMove task (cseg01:00052E78) so that it could be notified when the transport or dump operations conclude. Now the problem is that TaskAttack canceled the friendly unit’s TaskMove task through the TaskKillUnit task so TaskDump operates on a deinitialized TaskMove task object which means that the TaskDump task will dereference null pointers in the received TaskMove task object which leads to out of bounds read and write accesses under DOS systems that lead to segmentation faults on modern operating systems.
<br>
<br>
Proposed defect fix: Prepare TaskDump task member functions for deleted TaskMove tasks to prevent segmentation faults and abort TaskDump tasks in case there is no unit to activate. In case the TaskMove task has no passenger do not even try to instantiate a TaskDump task in the first place. These changes do not correct the various task interactions, but prevent crashes related to some of the incorrect interactions.

210. The TaskCreateBuilding task orders boardwalks (cseg01:0002ED2B), bridges, to be built on shore and water tiles around buildings that help ground units to move around. The game logic verifies every turn whether an ongoing or pending build order is required by an optional parent task or could it be canceled (cseg01:0002D56F). For example if a building is planned to be constructed, the boardwalks are also planned in at the same time. If the construction of the building is canceled, then it makes no sense to construct the boardwalks around an empty mass of land either. In corner cases the verification produces false positive results. The parent task of boardwalks are TaskCreateBuilding tasks themselves. The TaskCreateBuilding class method (cseg01:0002D3E9) used by the algorithm to check whether the task, the parent, is still needed says that the task is redundant if the building is already being constructed as at that time the unit working on the building would manage the operation till conclusion anyways though the unit orders system without a task manager task. So in every case when the building is started to be constructed before its’ boardwalks will result in the immediate cancellation of all boardwalks around it.

211. **[Fixed]** If the concurrent network play unit state desynchronization analyzer feature is enabled, the process is executed (cseg01:0009F0BA) at the beginning of each turn. Delayed unit reactions, like pending attacks, are not disabled during the operation which could lead to false positive error notifications due to temporary events like explosions. The proposed defect fix is to move the execution to the end of the turn when no pending reactions could be active anymore.

212. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:000FDFE7) that evaluates whether a friendly unit should abandon a previously pursued enemy unit. In case the enemy unit is not relevant anymore the pursuing friendly unit gets new orders to await and to cancel its already planned paths. In addition the stored enemy unit parameter of the friendly unit is cleared. In case of network play the new friendly unit orders and relevant unit parameters specific to the new order type are sent over the network to the remote peers to keep unit orders and unit states synchronized. E.g. if the new order type is `ORDER_MOVE`, then the enemy unit parameter and many others are sent to each remote peer. But if the new order type is `ORDER_AWAIT`, then the enemy unit parameter is not sent to the remote peers. This implies that an await order should have no impact on the affected unit’s enemy unit parameter. The problem in the given case is that the enemy unit parameter is cleared by the host, but due to the new await order this parameter is not synchronized back to the remote peers which might lead to an unrecoverable network play desynchronization event later on. The proposed defect fix is to send the enemy unit parameter for await order too.

213. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:000D9C10) to determine the type of saved game files to search for in the file system depending on the menu or game context. For example the multiplayer menu sets the `INI_GAME_FILE_TYPE` ini setting to `GAME_TYPE_MULTI` based on which the given function could correctly determine the saved game file type when the multiplayer host menu is active and the load button is pressed. But in case of scenario missions determining the saved game file type is not that trivial as they could be started by single player, multiplayer and hot seat game modes as well and each of them would have different file extensions for their saved game files. The given function misbehaves in the multiplayer host menu. First select a (multiplayer) scenario mission map. This action changes the game file type ini setting to `GAME_TYPE_MULTI_PLAYER_SCENARIO`. Then press the load button in the host menu which will invoke the given function and will first try to test whether the game runs in network operation mode which will always be false as network operation mode is enabled only after the host presses the start button. Next the function tries to determine whether multiple local players are registered which will always be false as we are setting up a multiplayer game not a hot seat one. Finally the algorithm will conclude that if the scenario mission game is not a network enabled nor a hot seat game, then it must be single player. At this point the user is presented by the list of available single player saved games within the multiplayer menu. The algorithm is simply broken in the multiplayer host menu after the user selected a scenario mission. The proposed defect fix is to set the game file type ini setting to type multiplayer whenever the load button is pressed in the host menu as all network multiplayer related saved game file types use the same file extension.

214. **[Fixed]** The player name can be set to an empty string in the setup window from the main menu. In the multiplayer lobby a player can host a game with a previously set empty string as game and player name. If such a game is started the saved game file of it will also store an empty string as the given player's name. There is a network menu member function (cseg01:000B390D) to draw the lobby screen, to populate the four player slots. Each player slot instantiates a GNW button instance if the given player slot is available for use in the saved game file. The relevant algorithm uses the saved player's name to decide whether the related player slot should be made available. An empty string as a player name means the slot is not available. Another part of the algorithm counts the player teams in the saved game file based on other class object members. Due to the inconsistency in loaded player teams and instantiated player slots a NULL pointer dereference occurs which leads to out of bounds access under DOS environment while utterly fails on modern operating systems with a segmentation fault. The proposed defect fix is to prevent saving games with empty strings as player names, to set valid names on load for existing corrupted saved game files, and to protect the GNW button instance pointers against dereferencing NULL just in case.

215. **[Fixed]** There is a ground path derived class virtual member function (cseg01:000BA570) that handles various blocked unit movement path use cases. It often happens that group movement of a unit is blocked by another friendly unit in the group that also wants to continue its path, but as the team's turn has ended it needs to wait for the next turn to start. In multiplayer game modes in such cases if the unit belongs to the local host the given function tells the blocked unit to request a new path while if the unit belongs to a remote host it simply tells the unit to wait for a new path from the remote host via the network. Problem is that the above corner case could occur while the local host team has already ended their turn, when the end turn timer timed out or was set directly to 0 via game options all along, in which case the local host will not generate and send a new path to the remote host before the current turn ends. The remote team is waiting for the new path and does not end its current turn until it is received as it runs in an order state that expects to receive a new path in the given turn. The local host could have notified the remote host to wait for the next turn to receive the new path instead by changing the unit's orders. This issue causes a deadlock. To make things worse, as the turn ended for one or more teams and the end turn timer timed out for them, they start a network synchronization procedure that must finish before 30 seconds otherwise the game reports network connection loss to the user due to failed synchronization that the offending team cannot even start to process. In the given scenario there is no issue with the network connection of course, it is a simple end turn lockup issue caused by incorrect control flow between local and remote hosts.
There are many cases where blocked paths are not reported to remote hosts, probably the game handles most of those cases gracefully in context specific ways. The proposed defect fix is to always report blocked paths to remote hosts regardless of the context which seems to work in the limited number of tested scenarios.

216. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:0009FCA3) to redraw the selected unit's statistics. The function does not check whether relevant image objects are valid before accessing their member methods. There is a corner case where the selected unit has a delayed reaction planned for it, as it ran out of rounds and waits to be able to attack again in the next turn, while the last enemy team is found to be defeated after ending the current turn. When the game over screen is presented to the user another function is called (cseg01:00092955) which deinitializes the selected unit relevant image objects. When the user closes the game over screen the tactical map is reloaded and the game loop renders a few more frames while the control panel closes on the left side and the game eventually returns to the main menu. Problem is that as the selected unit has a delayed reaction the unit statistics window is attempted to be redrawn by yet another function (cseg01:000A094D) before reloading the tactical map could have reinitialized the relevant image objects resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and a segmentation fault on modern operating systems. The proposed defect fix is to change the program flow to reinitialize the image objects before they could be referenced in the corner case.

217. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:000FE35D) to clean up all delayed or pending unit reactions. The given function is called only by a manager function that orchestrates attack priorities and related unit order states for mobile and stationary military units alike. Normally if all attacks are handled some units could remain in a delayed state still waiting to be allowed to shoot at something that is already destroyed. The given function is called by the manager to clean up these undesired pending unit states. Problem is that the given function only handles mobile units and forgets about stationary units. This could lead to stationary turrets stuck in attacking state in which case they cannot be put to sentry mode or this could prevent the player from targeting new enemy units rendering the given turret useless. Proposed defect fix is to clean up after stationary units as well within the given function.

218. **[Fixed]** The TaskAttackReserve task has a virtual member function that determines whether a unit is usable by the task (cseg01:00019770) and another that actually adds or assigns a unit to the task (cseg01:000198DE). The first method expects a military unit type to have the ability to move, to be a mobile unit, while the second method expects the unit to have speed points available in the given turn. If a mobile military unit with available ammo and shots in the given turn has no assigned task while it has spent all of its speed points, then the task manager tries to find a task for the unit, and in certain corner cases, an active TaskAttackReserve task will determine that the unit is usable as it is a mobile unit, but as soon as the task manager tries to add the unit to the task, the second method will find that it has no speed points left and will schedule a task manager reminder that the unit became available, meaning it has no task assigned anymore, so the task manager has to search for a new task for it. This is basically an endless loop.

219. **[Fixed]** When a factory finishes a build operation, a new UnitInfo object is instantiated (cseg01:000F1740) for the manufactured unit. The unit gets initial orders (ORDER_IDLE) and order states (ORDER_STATE_STORE), its grid position is set to be inside the factory, and the unit’s parent unit is set to be the factory that built it. The factory is also a UnitInfo object and its parent unit is set to be the newly manufactured unit. The factory’s active task is a TaskCreateUnit task which eventually progresses its state machine to the unit activation stage and when the TaskCreateUnit task is scheduled for execution the next time it assigns a TaskActivate task (cseg01:000393BA) to the factory unit which will in turn activate its configured parent unit, the manufactured unit. While the previously described state machine of the TaskCreateUnit task is reaching the activation stage, the computer player’s task scheduler will find that the newly instantiated UnitInfo object of the manufactured unit has no assigned tasks which will trigger a search for an eligible task type. If a new unit upgrade is researched or bought at the same turn when the manufactured unit gets instantiated there is a chance that the upgrade will be relevant for the new unit in which case the task scheduler will assign a TaskUpgrade task to it. The TaskUpgrade task searches a building that could perform the upgrade, e.g. a Depot, and progresses its state machine further. At one point the upgrade task checks whether the target unit is in ORDER_STATE_STORE which would mean that it is loaded inside the operator building, e.g. a Depot, and is ready to apply the upgrades. The needed raw materials to perform the upgrade are deducted from the complex of the operator building, e.g. a Depot in complex A, while the factory in which the manufactured unit stands could be in another complex, e.g. a light vehicle plant connected to complex B having no raw materials left, not to mention the fact that the unit to be upgraded is not even inside the operator building to begin with. After applying the upgrades the target unit’s parent gets a new TaskActivate task which means that now it has two such tasks. When the second TaskActivate task instance executes the function (cseg01:000FFC49) responsible for the actual activation, various unit internal states could become corrupted. The proposed defect fix is to prevent the task manager from assigning tasks to the newly manufactured unit that is waiting to be activated from the factory.

220. **[Fixed]** The TaskAssistMove task does not verify whether an already determined destination of a transporter unit's client is still valid at the time an unload order is issued for the transporter (cseg01:0005670A). The TaskAssistMove task is a manager task which means that each computer player has only one such task instance and it manages all transporters and all of their clients. There is a member function (cseg01:0005650E) which iterates through all managed transporters and if any of them are at a client's destination, and the target grid cell is not blocked by other units, the task assigns the unload order to the applicable transporters. This could lead to situations where multiple air transporters consider a recently blown up occupied bridge as a valid non blocked destination cell and all affected transporters unload their client units on top of each other into the sea.

	<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clips/defect_220.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
<br>
As the video clip demonstrates there are at least four more odd behaviors:
- Many air transporters are queuing to unload their client units to the very same single grid cell even though the manager task should know very well that all of the clients cannot be efficiently unloaded to the very same spot.
- Even though the scout would be able to move away from the given cell when TaskAssistMove issues a clear zone order (cseg01:0005670A), the scout does not move while unexpectedly the air transporters do clear out from the zone unnecessarily.
- Even worse, this leads to a race condition between affected air transporters as they clear each other out from the destination fighting to occupy the grid cell until all of them waste all of their speed points eventually.
- The air transporters have more than one clients loaded into their cargo bays and they are well aware that the closest client cannot be landed at the spot it wants to go, but instead of unloading the client into the close vicinity or serving another client that has a different destination that is unoccupied, the air transporters stall on the closest, but blocked client destination blocking all other servable clients in the process as well.

221. **[Fixed]** Military units can increase maximum shots by buying upgrades for credits or by research. Buying upgrades is only possible until the upgrade cost remains below 800 credits while research is unlimited. Increasing unit ammunition by research is not possible which means that it is possible to upgrade shots beyond the number of available ammunition. It makes no sense to display more shots than the maximum ammunition on the Unit Info and Unit Statistics windows. The rationale is that on turn start the available shots is reset to the number of available ammunition which means that it was not a design intent to be able to fire shots till ammo depletes, then reload the unit within the same turn by a supply truck or comparable and fire again.

222. **[Fixed]** The Unit Info and Unit Statistics windows display the unit actual and maximum hit points. The maximum hit points is stored as `unsigned short` by the UnitValues class, while unit current hit points are stored as `unsigned char` by the UnitInfo class. In case the maximum hit points of a building, or an alien concord unit, overflows the maximum value of `unsigned char` and unit current hit points become smaller than unit maximum hit points, then the automatic repair feature of buildings (cseg01:000F0D4C) connected to complexes with sufficient raw materials, or regeneration of alien concord units, kicks in. This leads to never ending cycles of wasting raw materials on automatic building repairs just to overflow the limit of current hit points again. See also defect 185 for reference. To properly fix the defect the save file format version needs to be updated. A temporary workaround to prevent this defective behavior could be to cap maximum unit hit points to the limit of `unsigned char`.

223. **[Fixed]** Research topic allocations are managed by a single function (cseg01:000D322D) by computer players, but the function is called from half a dozen call sites and in corner cases these call sites act upon research allocations inconsistently making it possible to end up with negative topic allocation values. When a new turn is started the game checks whether research center allocation of a topic is non zero in which case the turns to complete topic value is decreased by the allocation to topic value. In the corner case when allocation is negative this means that the turns to complete value actually increases due to subtraction of a negative value from it. The proposed defect fix is to make the algorithm more robust and do not allow negative allocations to be used in calculations.

224. **[Fixed]** There is a class to plausibility test resource production and consumption and if needed make automated adjustments to satisfy constraints and needs. The class has a method (cseg01:00041984) to check whether it is helpful to power off a non critical stationary building to satisfy resource consumption of more important buildings. For example if a heavy plant needs power to operate, but there is not enough fuel or power generating capacity, but there is a powered on research center, then the algorithm is allowed to power off the research center. The aforementioned method checks whether the non critical stationary building’s unit order is ORDER_POWER_OFF in which case it does not qualify for shutting off as it is assumed to be already powered off.
Computer players execute a complex class method (cseg01:0005B2EF) at the beginning of each turn and if ten or more fuel is stored in fuel storage units, then all currently powered off non critical stationary buildings are attempted to be turned back on. The algorithm does not check which complex has the fuel reserves or whether there are power generators or power stations that could be turned on within the complex.
There is a corner case where units are requested to be turned back on, with order ORDER_POWER_ON in order state ORDER_STATE_INIT, and they are eventually shut off again in the process even though they were not even on in the first place which means that certain events that shall only be executed once a unit is changing operating state from on to off are incorrectly triggered.
For example the computer player requests all currently powered off research centers, having order ORDER_POWER_OFF and order state ORDER_STATE_EXECUTING_ORDER, to be powered back on again at the beginning of a new turn by issuing order ORDER_POWER_ON and order state ORDER_STATE_INIT. Then the method from before checks whether there is sufficient power to turn on one of the affected research centers and it finds that no it is not possible so it orders some or all of the research centers to get turned off again including the one that is getting turned on right now by issuing order ORDER_POWER_OFF and order state ORDER_STATE_INIT again. Why can the plausibility test method qualify the affected research centers for an order to power off? Because they currently do not have order ORDER_POWER_OFF as the computer player changed their order in the beginning of the turn to be ORDER_POWER_ON and those orders are not yet processed for most of the affected units. All this means that an already powered off research center can get a new order to power on and before that order gets served the unit can get another order to get powered off again in which case the research topic allocation of the affected research center will be decremented incorrectly, eventually reaching a negative allocation. Unit orders shall not be allowed to change orders and order states inconsistently like this. The proposed defect fix is to make the plasuibility testing method more robust against the corner case. A more appropriate, but complex change would be to move all unit order and order state transition management into the UnitInfo class itself and only allow manager classes to request operations on UnitInfo objects via an encapsulated abstract API level.

225. **[Fixed]** There is a function (cseg01:001007BF) to remove a destroyed (exploding) unit. When a research center is destroyed the function does not check whether it was powered on, it just unconditionally calls the topic allocation manager function (cseg01:000D322D) to decrement the allocation counter even if the research center was powered off already. In corner cases when allocation becomes negative this means that the turns to complete value actually increases due to subtraction of a negative value from it. This issue affects both human and computer players. The proposed defect fix is to only call the allocation manager function if the destroyed research center is powered on.

226. Various unit attributes are outdated in the printed USA user manual (MN-ICD-082-0). The Shipyard Cost and Turns to build unit attributes shall be 40 and 20 on page 61. The Mining Station Cost and Turns to build unit attributes shall be 24 and 12 on page 62. The Turns to build attribute is generally missing for most units and it is recommended to remove this attribute from the manual uniformly. The Concrete Block Armor attribute shall be 16 on page 75. The Research Center Cost attribute shall be 24 on page 75. Infiltrator Cost shall be 9, Infantry Cost shall be 2 on page 78. Constructor Cost shall be 24 on page 79. Cargo of Bulldozer shall be 30 raw materials on page 80. Speed of Armored Personnel Carrier shall be 10 on page 83. The Escort Scan and Speed unit attributes shall both be 9 on page 90. The Corvette Armor and Speed unit attributes shall be 6 and 9 on page 91. The Gunboat Armor, Range and Hits unit attributes shall be 12, 7 and 32 on page 91. On page 92 the description of Submarines is misleading. The in-game description of the unit is much clearer. It's Attack and Speed unit attributes shall be 20 and 7. The Sea Transport speed shall be 7 on page 92. The Missile Cruiser range shall be 10 on page 93. The Cargo Ship speed shall be 7 on page 94.

227. There is a PurchaseTypeSelector derived class which has an overridden member function (cseg01:0007C7E7) to render a particular type selector item. The function calculates the unit purchase costs in raw materials. The function distinguishes between factory produced and builder built units. Factories use 3 raw materials per turn, builders only 2. But there is a third category as training hall units only use 1 raw material per turn. The initial upgrades variant of the Purchase Menu shows wrong Infiltrator and Infantry costs in the right side unit selection list.

228. Players are allowed to save games at any time without restrictions. When a previously saved game is loaded, certain unit movement related unit order states are reset back to a well defined semi-initial state (cseg01:000EC3E1). This is necessary as not every transient state of all state machines are saved into saved game files. Most unit movements are allowed to be performed parallel. Rockets, torpedos, alien missiles, alien plasma balls are actual units that get move unit orders. When such projectiles are flying around and the game is saved during this time frame various issues could occur on load.

<br>
As the video clip demonstrates there are several odd behaviors when the game is saved while a projectile was moving towards its destination:
- on load the projectile will stand still in air
- units cannot calculate paths
- game turn cannot be ended, but after several attempts units moved
- exit to menu via ESC or ALT+X do not work
<br>
Depending on the projectiles' unit order states a saved game might allow units to move on load, but do not allow them to attack anymore as the parent unit of the projectile is locked into attack state.

229. **[Fixed]** When a factory finishes building a unit it attempts to activate it. When all grid cell positions around the factory is blocked the factory gets blocked too. The factory is owned by a TaskCreateUnit task that requested the production of the newly built unit. The factory has order ORDER_BUILD and order state ORDER_STATE_BUILDING_READY. The task has CREATE_UNIT_STATE_ACTIVATING state. The manufactured unit is already spawned at the grid cell what is the top left position of the factory, but it is not visible, and it is owned by a TaskActivate task. When the infiltrator disables the factory (cseg01:000FCE8F) it updates both the previous order and the current order of it. The previous or old order becomes ORDER_HALT_BUILDING_2 and the new order becomes ORDER_DISABLE. The order states are updated as well and at the same time the factory gets stripped of all tasks it had. When the disabled state elapses the factory removes the ORDER_DISABLE order and restores ORDER_HALT_BUILDING_2. The task manager (cseg01:00045466) checks every turn whether there are idling units having no tasks and finds that now the factory has no tasks assigned. Typically the factory will be assigned a new TaskCreateUnit task to build something new even though in this case the previously produced unit is still waiting to be activated from the factory. It is clear that in normal circumstances the factory does not start to build something new while the previous is still waiting to be activated so this should not be allowed after a factory recovers from being disabled either.

<br>
The proposed defect fix is to check whether the factory has a parent unit, the last built unit waiting to be activated, which is assigned a TaskActivateTask which has a builder unit associated with it that is the factory in question and in such a case do not assign the factory a new task, instead restore its orders that factories would normally have in these circumstances.

230. **[Fixed]** The tileset of Ultima Thule (MD5 hash 39fb184442e026d919a6ba89cd7e1612 \*SNOW_5.WRL) misses a tile art at grid cell position \[055,066\]. When the tile is added back to the set the pass table of the planet should be updated too.

231. **[Fixed]** The tilemap of Ice Berg (MD5 hash bddc3f12fc856009ba539b82303ae46a \*SNOW_3.WRL) places a wrong tile art at cell position \[057,057\]. Tile 55 needs to be set for the tilemap position.

232. **[Fixed]** When a factory finishes building a unit a TaskActivate task is created that tries to find a free grid cell position around the factory where the unit can be activated. In case there are no free locations the task searches for friendly units that obstruct the way and tells the first one found to clear out (cseg01:00053ED0). Until the unit in the way moves the same function is not searching for free locations anymore. There are corner cases where this behavior creates soft lock situations.

<br>
The video clip demonstrates that the repair unit of the green computer cannot move as it is a land unit while infiltrators can move around using shore tiles. When the light vehicle plant finishes manufacturing an engineer there are no free grid cell locations, but the friendly repair unit is obstructing so it is commanded to clear out from the zone that the unit cannot execute as there are no free land grid cells around it. Moving out of the way with the infiltrators after this event does not help as the TaskActivate task does not check free grid cell locations anymore. As soon as the friendly unit is lost and the clear zone command becomes obsolete the TaskActivate task searches for free locations again and immediately finds that there is a way. There is another related issue that the TaskActivate task is only issuing a clear out zone command for the first friendly unit found and in cases where there would be more friendlies and only the first one is unable to move the algorithm would soft lock again. 
<br>
Proposed defect fix:
- Always search for free grid cell locations irrespective of previously requested clear out zone commands.
- In case a free grid cell is found mark an existing Zone object as unimportant.
- Always add all unique obstructed locations and try any of them until one succeeds.

233. **[Fixed]** On the starting location selection screen players can select the landing site by two actions. 1) pressing the enter key on the keyboard lets the computer AI select a landing site automatically or 2) pressing the left mouse button selects a desired location. In both cases the game renders a red and a yellow circle around the position. The game does this using a trick. There is a mobile unit called the **Master Builder** which was cut from the game, its sprites are removed from the game asset library so it renders fully transparent. The circles are nothing more than the attack and scan range indicators of that unit around the landing location. The game just increases the unit's scan and attack range hacking its unit attributes, then the invisible unit is deleted and replaced by a mining station and a power generator next to it. All this means that when the players selected a landing location there is an actively select unit, the master builder. That is why we can see the unit's scan and attack range indicators. The two landing site selection methods take different control flow paths, but both progress the game operation mode state machine from starting location selection mode to a different one. In case of hot seat game mode with at least two human players the state machine performs these game operation mode state machine changes at least twice. If two starting location zones overlap there are further similar game operation mode state machine changes.
- If a player uses the left mouse button to select a new location after the overlap warning then the game first queries human input events (cseg01:0009963D), processes the events (cseg01:000962D9), selects a mouse cursor sprite that is appropriate for the processed mouse position on screen (cseg01:00097FB2) while the game operation mode state machine is in starting location selection mode and eventually the game finds that the left mouse button was clicked in which case the game operation mode state machine leaves the starting location selection mode state.
- In case the user presses enter instead of the left mouse button the game first queries human input events (cseg01:0009963D), processes the events (cseg01:000962D9) and finds that the enter key was pressed so it lets the computer AI select a site and the game operation mode state machine leaves the starting location selection mode before the mouse cursor sprite was processed by (cseg01:00097FB2). Now the cursor selection function takes a different path as the game operation mode is already something different. At this time the invisible master builder mobile unit is still selected actively and the unit has an ORDER_IDLE unit order which is coincidentally a precondition for another mouse cursor selection scheme where the master builder land unit is considered to be a client of another unit. For example the mobile unit could be a client of a depot or an air transporter. The game assumes that the client has a parent unit which of course does not exist and when the parent is attempted to be accessed the code dereferences a null pointer. Such accesses read random memory contents and operations conclude gracefully without crashes on DOS systems. On modern operating systems such out of bounds accesses cause segmentation faults and the game crashes immediately.

     The proposed defect fix is to test for null pointer.

234. **[Fixed]** The UnitInfo class has a field called recoil_delay. This is an animation frame counter for military unit attack phases. The original developers did not want to change the save file format close to the release deadline and they reused the field to also track the disabled state of units. A unit can be disabled by an infiltrator for one or more turns. The UnitInfo class has 3 constructors (cseg01:000E89FA, cseg01:000E8BC2, cseg01:000E9237) and these do not initialize all class member fields. Scenario, training and campaign missions were created using a developer or debug feature called the Quick Build Menu which uses a UnitInfo constructor variant that does not initialize the recoil_delay field. Due to this issue most units found in affected missions have random garbage values in their recoil_delay field. The proposed defect fix is to initialize all fields of the UnitInfo class and to load plausible recoil_delay values from existing save files (all missions are just normal save files too).
