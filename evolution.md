# Preface
A lot of research goes into M.A.X. Port and its incedibly fun, sometimes shocking, to learn about the history of the game. The article documents and presents to the reader the more memorable findings, stories or whatever fine detail that is known. The article will surely contain many subjective inferences, but the author tries to be objective and provide references to the source of information as much as possible.

# Historical Events

Ali N. Atabek, project manager and producer of M.A.X., was the founder of Mindcraft Software in 1989 [\[1\]](#ref1). The company developed more than a dozen games between 1989 and 1993 and won several gaming awards.
According to an interview in Computer Gaming World [\[2\]](#ref2) the company had around 40 associates by end of 1993 and worked on several new titles parallel. The last game mentioned in the interview is very interesting: **_"... and are working on a sci-fi strategy game with the working title Mechamender (sort of Dune II meets the BattleTech universe)."_**. According to the Mindcraft interview Mechamender was under development in 1993 already. Mindcraft worked with 256 color SVGA technology already in 1993 which is used by M.A.X. as well. On the other hand M.A.X. is based on GNW, a user interface and OS-abstraction library, which was designed and programmed by Timothy Cain [\[3\]](#ref3) from Interplay. GNW is responsible for video, user input, windowing and related control widgets. In this sense most of the visual engine technology used in the game came from Interplay.
<br><br>

The MAX.INI configuration file is referred to as MANDER.INI within the game executable and MANDER.H declared all the units.<br>
On MS-DOS a file name is typically less than eight characters long due to the formal 8.3 file name format.<br>
Could it be that Mander is the abbreviated form of Mechamender?

<br><br>
_"Classic BattleTech is a table-top wargame set in the fictional BattleTech universe that simulates combat between futuristic mechanized forces._<br>
_Of the units represented in the game, the most common are BattleMechs, also known as 'Mechs: large, semi-humanoid fighting machines controlled by human pilots"_ [\[4\]](#ref4).<br><br>
_"In the future portrayed in M.A.X., military conflict and conquest is a function performed by self-operating machines under the control and direction of M.A.X. Commanders"_ [\[5\]](#ref5).
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 100%; text-align: right;"}


<br><br>
Atabek and Paul Kellner joined Interplay Prodcutions in 1994 as producers. They helped publish Cyberia in 1994 and Virtual Pool in mid 1995 for Interplay.
<br><br>

M.A.X. is based on an original idea by Larry Froistad who worked at Mindcraft Software between 1991 and 1993 at least. Froistad worked on several Mindcraft titles together with Atabek and Kellner during that time. Froistad most probably did not join Interplay as he was living in Bowman, North Dakota around 1994-1995.
<br><br>

**M.A.X. is Dedicated to the memory of Amanda Froistad.**<br>
Froistad molested he's 5 year old daughter and murdered her in 1995, but this was not proven until 1998 when Froistad confessed both crimes [\[6\]](#ref6).
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 100%; text-align: right;"}

<br><br>
So in theory Froistad could not have joined Interplay which was located in Irvine, California as he had to be in North Dakota at the time. Atabek and Kellner were working on other titles till at least mid of 1995 when Virtual Pool was released for MS-DOS. So if the original game idea of M.A.X. came from Froistad, and Froistad himself did not work for Interplay, then the idea most probably came from him back in 1993 or earlier. This would be yet another reason to think that M.A.X. could be Mechamender from Mindcraft Software.

 Based on MobyGames developer biographies many engineers working on M.A.X. were first time credited so they surely had no connections to Mindcraft. But there is one important exception, Anthony Postma. He worked at both companies as a graphics artist. In case of M.A.X. he and Kellner were writers as well. If M.A.X. is Mechamender, than the reason for this is obvious. By the way Postma is not credited on MobyGames for any games between he's last one at Mindcraft back in 1993 and M.A.X. at Interplay in 1996 so maybe he was hired exactly due to he's history with Mechamender.

Another interesting fact from Mindcraft's legacy is that Edward Del Castillo also worked there in 1993. Later he worked on the Command & Conquer series as writer and producer between 1995-1997 and in 2020 (C&C Remastered Collection). Just think about it. The producers of M.A.X. (Mechamender) and the C&C games came from the very same small company. What happened with Mindcraft? **Why did Mindcraft disappear in 1994?**
<br><br>

"We also know that Mindcraft is careful enough with the production costs that most of their titles break even at a sales level far below other companies in the industry.<br>
That means this company is likely to be around for a long time to come - October 1993, Computer Gaming World"

Several screenshots exist that show content that originates from before the first available interactive demo. These screenshots depict a M.A.X. that is very different from the final design. The following screenshots have time stamps from July 21st, 1996 [\[7\]](#ref7).

The first screenshot shows the old design of the ground attack plane. The _charge_ attribute indicates that units had fuel; the game resource file called . The art was later modified to become the alien attack plane.
Some of the dark themed UI elements can also be found within older versions of the game resource file, MAX.RES.

<br><br>
The first version of the game that was found so far is the V1.00 interactive demo from 15th of August, 1996. An internal test build, or press presentation demo, from one week later was put on a major gaming magazine's cover CD instead of the public demo version [\[8\]](#ref8). This is the most interesting build that is available from the game.

<br><br>
The first retail version of the game that was found so far is V1.0.1 from December 10, 1996.

The second retail version gone gold just two days later. This indicates that the series release was rushed. The developers must have had an incredibly high pressure on thir backs. Competitors like War Wind, KKND, C&C Red Alert, Dark Reign, Gene Wars were all on their way and the end of the year holidays season was upon them too. This second retail copy was V1.02 from December 12, 1996.

"A game has _"Gone Gold"_ when the final master copy has been produced at the developer and sent off for replication, packaging and shipment.<br>
The game is not yet released, but it will typically be around 2-3 weeks (sometimes less) before it begins appearing on store shelves<br>
and online pre-orders arriving at doorsteps. The term itself comes from the old practice of recordable CDs being manufactured with gold film.<br>
Hence the gold colored CD actually being the source, with no reference to copies sold as in the recording industry." - Urban Dictionary
