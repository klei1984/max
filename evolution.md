# Preface
A lot of research goes into M.A.X. Port and its incedibly fun, sometimes shocking, to learn about the history of the game. The article documents and presents to the reader the more memorable findings, stories or whatever fine detail that is known. The article will surely contain many subjective inferences, but the author tries to be objective and provide references to the source of information as much as possible.

# Historical Events

Ali N. Atabek, project manager and producer of M.A.X., was the founder of Mindcraft Software in 1989 [\[1\]](#ref1). The company developed more than a dozen games between 1989 and 1993 and won several gaming awards.
According to an interview in Computer Gaming World [\[2\]](#ref2) the company had around 40 associates by end of 1993 and worked on several new titles parallel. The last game mentioned in the interview is very interesting: **_"... and are working on a sci-fi strategy game with the working title Mechamender (sort of Dune II meets the BattleTech universe)."_**.
<br><br>

The MAX.INI configuration file is referred to as MANDER.INI within the game executable.<br>
On MS-DOS a file name is typically less than eight characters long due to the formal 8.3 file name format.<br>
Could it be that Mander is the abbreviated form of Mechamender?

<br><br>
M.A.X. is based on an original idea by Larry Froistad who worked at Mindcraft Software between 1991 and 1993. Froistad worked on several Mindcraft titles together with Paul Kellner and Atabek during that time.<br>
Atabek joined Interplay Prodcutions as a producer in 1994 with several other former Mindcraft associates including Kellner. The two helped publish Cyberia in 1994 and Virtual Pool in mid 1995 for Interplay. 
Froistad most probably did not join Interplay as he was living in Bowman, North Dakota around 1994-1995.
<br><br>

**M.A.X. is Dedicated to the memory of Amanda Froistad.**<br>
Froistad molested he's 5 year old daughter and murdered her in 1995, but this was not proven until 1998 when Froistad confessed both crimes [\[3\]](#ref3).

<br><br>
So in theory Froistad could not have joined Interplay which was located in Irvine, California as he had to be in North Dakota. Atabek and Kellner were working on other titles till at least mid of 1995 when Virtual Pool was released for MS-DOS. So if the original game idea of M.A.X. came from Froistad, and Froistad himself does not appear anywhere else in the credits of the game so he did not actively worked on it, then the idea should have came from him back in 1993 or earlier which would indicate that M.A.X. is truly Mechamender from Mindcraft Software. According to the Mindcraft interview Mechamander was under development in 1993 already. Mindcraft worked with 256 color SVGA technology already in 1993 which is the basis for M.A.X. as well.

Another interesting fact from Mindcraft's legacy is that Edward Del Castillo also worked there in 1993. Later he worked on the Command & Conquer series as writer and producer in 1995-1997, 2020 (C&C Remastered Collection). Just think about it. The producers of M.A.X. (Mechamender) and the C&C games came from the very same small company. What happened with Mindcraft? Why did the company disappear in 1994?
<br><br>

"We also know that Mindcraft is careful enough with the production costs that most of their titles break even at a sales level far below other companies in the industry.<br>
That means this company is likely to be around for a long time to come - October 1993, Computer Gaming World"

Several screenshots exist that show content that originates from before the first available interactive demo. These screenshots depict a M.A.X. that is very different from the final design. The following screenshots have time stamps from July 21st, 1996 [\[4\]](#ref4).

The first screenshot shows the old design of the ground attack plane. The _charge_ attribute indicates that units had fuel. The art was later modified to become the alien attack plane.
Some of the black UI elements can also be found within older versions of the game resource file, MAX.RES.

<br><br>
The first retail version of the game that was found so far is V1.0.1 from December 10, 1996.

The second retail version gone gold just two days later. This indicates that the series release was rushed. The developers must have had an incredibly high pressure on thir backs. Competitors like War Wind, KKND, C&C Red Alert, Dark Reign, Gene Wars were all on their way and the end of the year holidays season was upon them too. This second retail copy was V1.02 from December 12, 1996.

"A game has _"Gone Gold"_ when the final master copy has been produced at the developer and sent off for replication, packaging and shipment.<br>
The game is not yet released, but it will typically be around 2-3 weeks (sometimes less) before it begins appearing on store shelves<br>
and online pre-orders arriving at doorsteps. The term itself comes from the old practice of recordable CDs being manufactured with gold film.<br>
Hence the gold colored CD actually being the source, with no reference to copies sold as in the recording industry." - Urban Dictionary
