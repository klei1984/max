# Preface
A lot of research goes into M.A.X. Port and its incedibly fun, sometimes shocking, to learn about the history of the game. The article documents and presents to the reader the more memorable findings, stories or whatever fine detail that is known. The article will surely contain many subjective inferences, but the author tries to be objective and provide references to the source of information as much as possible.

# Historical Events

{% include image_note.html image="ceo_ali_atabek.jpg" title="" description="Mindcraft Software CEO Ali Atabek examines cover painting for Dominion. [\[2\]](#ref2)" %}
Ali N. Atabek, project manager and producer of M.A.X., was one of the founders of Mindcraft Software in January 1989 [\[1\]](#ref1).
The company developed more than a dozen games between 1989 and 1993 and won several gaming awards.
According to an interview in Computer Gaming World (CGW) [\[2\]](#ref2) the company had around 40 associates by end of 1993 and worked on several new titles parallel. The last game mentioned in the interview is very interesting: **_"... and are working on a sci-fi strategy game with the working title Mechamender (sort of Dune II meets the BattleTech universe)."_**.<br>

The game is actually called Mechamander, but CGW mispelled it in the interview. According to the article the game was under development already in 1993. The name Mechamander is most probably combined from the phrase _Mech Commander_.

According to the article Mindcraft started to work with 256 color SVGA technology already in 1993 which is used by M.A.X. as well. On the other hand the engine used in M.A.X. is based on GNW, a user interface and OS-abstraction library, which was designed and programmed by Timothy Cain [\[3\]](#ref3) from Interplay. GNW is responsible for video, user input, windowing and related control widgets. In this sense most, if not all, of the visual engine technology used in the game came from Interplay.

<br style="clear:both"><br>
The MAX.INI configuration file is referred to as MANDER.INI within the game executable and MANDER.H declared all the units.<br>
On MS-DOS a file name is typically less than eight characters long due to the formal 8.3 file name format.<br>
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 100%; text-align: right;"}

<br><br>
_"Classic BattleTech is a table-top wargame set in the fictional BattleTech universe that simulates combat between futuristic mechanized forces._<br>
_Of the units represented in the game, the most common are BattleMechs, also known as 'Mechs: large, semi-humanoid fighting machines controlled by human pilots"_ [\[4\]](#ref4).<br><br>
_"In the future portrayed in M.A.X., military conflict and conquest is a function performed by self-operating machines under the control and direction of M.A.X. Commanders"_ [\[5\]](#ref5).
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 100%; text-align: right;"}


<br><br>
Mindcraft's 1993 software catalog [\[6\]](#ref6) describes Mechamader as follows: _"Far in the future, fully-mechanized, highly-skilled mercenary legions will be available for hire to smaller, independent planets of the galaxy. In Mechamanderâ„¢ you own and lead such a legion. With men and equipment, you travel from planet to planet fulfilling the terms of each contract. After each successful mission, you can recruit new men (to replace those lost), purchase new equipment (if you can afford it), and choose a new contract from among those offered.<br>**Available in October 1993.**"_<br>


"We also know that Mindcraft is careful enough with the production costs that most of<br>their titles break even at a sales level far below other companies in the industry.<br>
That means this company is likely to be around for a long time to come - October 1993, Computer Gaming World"
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 100%; text-align: right;"}

But the game did not see a release in October 1993.

Mindcraft bundled various marketing and support materials to their retail and demo releases. In the Walls of Rome v1.0 demo from November 1993 Mechamander is portrayed as follows:

_MECHAMANDER (Available January 1994)_
  
----
<br>
_It is a time when the Earth, stripped of her ores and minerals, is nothing more than a soggy crust in space._  
_Mining corporations look to the stars to make their fortunes, but in space, it takes more than a good marketing strategy to survive!_  
  
_As the Mechamander, your job is to drop on ore-rich planetoids, "clean-up" any opposition, and secure ores and minerals to be sent back to Earth. Your company provides the state-of-the-art brawn -- a Dropship complete with refinery and production facilities.  You provide the brains for strategies on where to mine, what to build, and when to attack. Balance your company's weapons of destruction with mining and repair facilities, and set out to claim your piece of the pie._  
  
_This isn't going to be an easy salary, though! Government regulations don't exist in the void. Other mining empires, each with its own prototype vehicles, have the same idea about making their profit, and eliminating the competition amongst the rocks in space!_  

_KEY FEATURES_
* _Become the Mechamander for one of the following mining corporations:_  
  _Dantai Shi, Delta Resource Group, Industrial Commonwealth of Europe, American Mining Corp._
* _Each computer competitor has their own unique AI "personality"._
* _Command up to 18 mining and attack vehicles, each as unique as the company that makes them!_
* _Mobile production facilities keep your base of operations out of trouble and in the ore!_
* _An innovative player interface lets you commit to strategy, not to finding the right buttons._
* _Track your units as they move smoothly and realistically across the theater of action._

Note the system requirements: 640 KB RAM, VGA graphics, and a 33 MHz 32 bit CPU. For comparison Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty (1992) from Westwood Studios, Inc. had the following minimum system requirements for the floppy version: 546 KB RAM, VGA graphics, and a 16 bit CPU.

According to an advertisement a playable Mechamander demo existed in March, 1994 [\[7\]](#ref7).<br><br>
Then in the July 1994 issue of Computer Gaming World magazine a news article reported that Mindcraft Software is no more. _"**Mindcraft**, following on hard times and disappointing sales, was forced to file bankruptcy. However, its founder, Ali Atabek, is now producer at Interplay Productions and is expected to finish the MECHAMANDER strategy game for that company. MECHAMANDER may well be named MECH COMMANDER before the project ships, but Ali's original vision is still expected to reach the market in 1994."_ [\[8\]](#ref8)


There is actually a game series titled Mech Commander which plays in the official (licensed) BattleTech universe. The first game came out in 1998. It was developed by FASA Studio and published by MicroProse Software, Inc.

Another interesting fact from Mindcraft's legacy is that Edward Del Castillo also worked there in 1993. Later he worked on the Command & Conquer series as writer and producer between 1995-1997 and in 2020 (C&C Remastered Collection). Just think about it. The producers of M.A.X. (Mechamader) and the C&C games came from the very same small company.
<br style="clear:both"><br>

# Development of M.A.X. at Interplay

So Atabek joined Interplay Prodcutions in 1994 as producer and was supposed to bring Mechamander to release. Paul Kellner, another former Mindcraft associate, also joined Interplay at that time and the two together helped publish Cyberia in 1994 and Virtual Pool in mid 1995.

The UK based PC GAMER magazine wrote in its February 1995 issue that _"As for Virgin's MechaMander, it's in the works with no set release date."_ [\[9\]](#ref9). Virgin Interactive Entertainment distributed many Interplay titles in Europe and M.A.X. was no exception to that in 1996. On the other hand the journalist might have simply mixed-up something.
<br><br>
  
----
M.A.X. is based on an original idea by Larry Froistad who worked at Mindcraft Software between 1991 and 1993 at least. Froistad worked on several Mindcraft titles during that time. Froistad most probably did not join Interplay as he was living in Bowman, North Dakota around 1994-1995.
<br>

**M.A.X. is Dedicated to the memory of Amanda Froistad.**<br>
Froistad molested he's 5 year old daughter and murdered her in 1995, but this was not proven until 1998 when Froistad confessed both crimes [\[10\]](#ref10).

<br><br>

Based on MobyGames developer biographies many engineers working on M.A.X. were first time credited so they surely had no connections to Mindcraft. But there is one important exception, Anthony Postma. He worked at both companies and is a key figure in the artistic design of M.A.X.

Mr. Postma was very kind and allowed us to show he's magnificent concept art sketches within the article and he also answered all of our questions in great detail.

Question: _My current understanding is that MechaMander became M.A.X. eventually. Could this be true?_  
**Answer**: _I believe so... MechaMander or Mech Commander was a game idea that was being considered during my time at Mindcraft Software (I worked there on and off between 88-94), before the business closed... Then Ali Atabek took it onto Interplay, I recall._
  
Question: _According to an article in Electronic Games magazine, issue March 1994, there was a working interactive demo of MechaMander. Was this a too optimistic advertisement only or did the demo really exist?_  
**Answer**: _I canâ€™t be too sure what existed of the game at the time of the article... I was very busy finishing up my degree at Art Center College of Design, and wasnâ€™t very aware of what was happening with Mindcraftâ€™s projects._
  
Question: _Other than the advertisement I found no pictures or any visuals from the game. Do you remember how far the game progressed during its development at Mindcraft? Based on the various articles and M.A.X. resources I studied so far I am convinced that MechaMander's source code was repurposed for M.A.X. one way or another._  
**Answer**: _I have vague recollections of images or animations being shown at CES around that time... I didnâ€™t attend the convention with the Mindcraft crew, so I'm unaware of what was actually previewed. It could have been a playable demo, but I'm not sure... When I began working on MechaMander/MAX at Interplay, I was also unaware how much of the original source code was repurposed... I freelanced during the first few months of MAX's development doing storyboards and vehicle designs, so I wasnâ€™t knowledgeable of much else on the project._
  
Question: _According to an in-house Interplay interview with Ali Atabek the development of M.A.X. was (re)started only in 1996 and the development time was about 10 months only. What could have happened between 1994 and 1996 and what did you work on back then?_  
**Answer**: _I freelanced for Interplay in '94, starting full time in '95... MAX's or MechaMander's production was going at the time, but some of my time I did work on other games... concept art for Shattered Steel, Star Trek Starfleet Academy, concept and UI design for Fallout (the vault cog door and found objects as maps were my contributions)... and some misc art for a few other titles... But the majority of my time was directed towards MAX... I'm unsure of the details of that time, but I do remember MAX's production being interrupted or throttled back a few times, for reasons I canâ€™t be sure of._
  
Question: _According to the game credits you not only created concept designs for M.A.X. but also worked as a 2D artist, a writer and even the awesome box cover design is your merit. What kind of story elements did you add to the game? And as a 2D artist did you work on unit sprites, world tiles, menu graphics or all of that? I am still astonished at the quality of the graphics and the color or palette animations. The water effect is simply amazing. Were the 2D unit sprites made by hand or were they rendered and post processed from 3D models? Did you draw everything on paper first and scanned the drawings or was everything made digitally from scratch?_  
**Answer**: _I wore a lot of hats on both MAX and what became MAX2... the name was my creation, M.A.X. Mechanized Assault & eXploration was my idea, because the project ran into legal issues with the name MechaMander or Mech Commander which I think FASA Studio owned or owns... I helped write up history and backgrounds to the various factions, and the alien species for MAX2, The Sheevat. I did all the concept sketches for the vehicles and structures, then worked with the 3D modelers (Mark Bergo and Chris Regalado) as they developed and textured the models, then I processed the Sprites, providing explosions and lighting animations and such. I did box cover designs as well for both MAX and MAX2, but was not responsible for the finished artwork, which was completed by an outside agency I believe... I did UI design for both games, working on icons and buttons, and I also provided the Story Boards for the intro animation... I was fairly involved in all of the graphic aspects of the game. Even did some play testing as the AI was being sorted out by the programmers. It was a pretty fun period in my time in game development... always something new to envision._

Interplay filed the first trademark application for _"M.A.X. MECHANIZED ASSAULT & EXPLORATION"_ in the USA on April 19th, 1996. A second application covering broader range of goods was filed on 20th of June, 1996.
<br style="clear:both"><br><br>

Several screenshots exist that show content that originates from before the first available interactive demo. These screenshots depict a M.A.X. that is very different from the final design. The following screenshots have time stamps from July 21st, 1996 [\[11\]](#ref11).

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/secret_service_max05.png" alt="secret service screenshot">

The first screenshot shows the old design of the ground attack plane. The _charge_ attribute indicates that units had fuel; the game resource called ATTRIBS also contains the fuel unit attribute even in the retail version of the game. The art was later modified to become the alien attack plane.
Some of the dark themed UI elements can also be found within older versions of the game resource file, MAX.RES.

The December, 1996 issue of the German PC Games magazine [\[12\]](#ref12) featured a video report about their visit at Interplay. There is a short interview with Ali Atabek about M.A.X. in it.

The video demonstrates two different versions of the game. Based on the main menu graphics the modern looking one is newer than the V1.00 and V1.01 interactive demos, but it is not the retail version as it has the internal build warning message on the title screen. The other version has the dark GUI design and is very interesting.
* At time stamp 00:55.733 the master builder is shown which was cut from the later versions of the game. This proves that the unit art existed. This is the only unit in the retail version of the game for which sprites do not exist.
* At time stamp 01:28.667 the master builder animation starts, but this version plays during the day while in the retail version of the game the video plays at night or on a world where there is no direct sunlight.
* The music track playing in the background is Cold Reality from Descent II.  
<br><br>

The first version of the game that was found so far is the V1.00 interactive demo from 15th of August, 1996. An internal test build, or press presentation demo, from one week later was put on a major gaming magazine's cover CD instead of the public demo version [\[13\]](#ref13). When it comes to development history and research this is the most interesting build that is available from the game.

| 00:57.851 | At the end of the game credits Gus Smedstad hidden a secret message which was removed in the V1.01 Interactive Demo.

| 01:36.662 | The landing sequence screen did not have the protective panels on the left in case of tutorial missions. The English localization was hard coded into the graphics assets at the time. The developers probably considered internationalization way too late in the development.

<br><br>
The first retail version of the game that was found so far is V1.0.1 from December 10, 1996.

The second retail version gone gold just two days later. This indicates that the series release was rushed. The developers must have had an incredibly high pressure on thir backs. Competitors like War Wind, KKND, C&C Red Alert, Dark Reign, Gene Wars were all on their way and the end of the year holidays season was upon them too. This second retail copy was V1.02 from December 12, 1996.

"A game has _"Gone Gold"_ when the final master copy has been produced at the developer and sent off for replication, packaging and shipment.<br>
The game is not yet released, but it will typically be around 2-3 weeks (sometimes less) before it begins appearing on store shelves<br>
and online pre-orders arriving at doorsteps. The term itself comes from the old practice of recordable CDs being manufactured with gold film.<br>
Hence the gold colored CD actually being the source, with no reference to copies sold as in the recording industry." - Urban Dictionary
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 100%; text-align: right;"}

Interplay made an inhouse interview with Ali Atabek in December 1996 [\[14\]](#ref14). It is rather strange that the interviewer could not even spell Atabek's name correctly and that the interview begins with utter nonsense. _"... You have the opportunity to dominate a maximum of 24 worlds and eight clans-- each with its own advanced artificial intelligence (AI). All that you need to do is solve the problems of war, famine and pestilence. You must also reverse ecological collapse, genetic manipulation and tectonic disasters that, otherwise, would surely result in the demise of the world."_ - Say what? Tectonic disasters, famine and pestilence? Genetic manipulation and the demise of the world? In this game the player is supposed to conquer countless new worlds for the Condord so who cares about the demise of "the" world? But then again the campaign is all about getting our hands on technologies and alien artefacts giving a damn about the dominion of worlds and in this effort 4 clans are actually our allies.

Another interesting sentence from the interview says that _"the goal for the creation of M.A.X. was to have been a step above Virgin's "Command and Conquer" meets "Conquest of the New World"_. Probably the interviewer wanted to say that M.A.X. wanted to combine the merits of "Command & Conquer" and "Conquest of the New World". Mechamander had similar ideas in 1993. Conquest of the New World is a strategy title published by Interplay.

According to the interview M.A.X. was scheduled to be released on December 30th, 1996 and the development lasted about 10 months only which implies that M.A.X. was not actively developed during 1994 and 1995 which is not true. Shortly after Atabek was promoted to become division head of Interplay's new strategy division called Flat Cat [\[15\]](#ref15).
