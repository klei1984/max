    - The Sanctuary map marks tile 190 as blocked while based on the tile art
      it should be passable land. A new game needs to be started for the fix
      to take effect.
    - In corner cases computers were unable to start production even if they
      had the materials to do so.
    - Computers were able to upgrade units that were waiting for initial
      activation from factories which led to various glitches or crashes.
    - In corner cases computers were able to restart unit construction even if
      a previously constructed unit was waiting initial activation.
    - In corner cases computers were unable to activate units even if it would
      have been possible to do so.
    - The tileset of Ultima Thule missed a tile art at grid cell position
      [055,066]. The tile is added back. A new game needs to be started for
      part of the fix to take effect.
    - The tilemap of Ice Berg places a wrong tile art at cell position
      [057,057].
    - The game could crash in a corner case when the player uses both mouse and
      keyboard to select a starting location on the map.
    - Missions that were originally made with the quick build developer feature
      incorrectly set the disabled state turn counter for deployed units that
      could lead to various glitches.
    - In corner cases opening the in-game Preferences window in hot seat games
      could reopen the game over screen for already defeated players.

  * Corrected reimplementation issues:
    - Corrected GNW UI wide color support.
    - Fixed a potential random crash in case of early assertion hits.

  * Reimplementation changes:
    - Updated SDL2 library to v2.32.6.
    - Added source patch to miniaudio 0.11.22 to fix audio loop point support.
    - Added JSON, JSON Schema, utf8proc and LUA dependencies.
    - Added new modules in preparation to support new missions.
    - Implemented process_pull_down, win_debug and win_debug_delete GNW
      features, removed two assertions.
    - Added assertion test to catch buildings with move orders.
    - Refactored various modules.
