M.A.X. Port uses a new audio engine called [Miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/). The new engine made it possible to integrate sound effect loop point support, streaming audio playback for MVE videos and better 2D panning. The engine also supports 3D audio spatialization which would be an interesting feature to add to M.A.X. in the future.

The recent improvements and this latest update makes M.A.X. Port's playability comparable to the original in single player and hot seat game modes. Network play is not implemented yet. There will be occasional crashes or other gameplay issues still, but hopefully nothing that completely breaks the game in a way that it cannot be recovered from last turn's backup save. It is also worth mentioning that up until now 112 original game defects are fixed out of the known 206.

Enjoy this new video footage showcasing the latest improvements.
