M.A.X. has many hidden secrets.
<br><br>Back in 1996 when I played the v1.00 Interactive Demo I seen a building called **Monopole Mine** that was not possible to build actually. The building required 60 game turns to build and the demo concluded after just 50 turns of gameplay; in the v1.00 demo faster build time for more resources was not available yet.
<br>Any ways the building's statistics was actually observable via the initial upgrades menu and I always wondered what was the purpose of this building and why was it removed from the retail version. A building that exploits magnetic monopoles for free infinite energy... sure would have had come in handy as a super-duper power generator if there would have been buildings that would have consumed tons of energy... like a shield generator for example.
<br><br>Apparently there are several buildings and even a mobile unit that never made it into the actual game in the form as they were originally designed. For example the **Recreation Center** was converted into an **Alien Derelict**. A recreation center? Like foot soldiers not only gain experience level, but would require relaxation? Or productivity in Eco-Spheres could be increased by relaxed workers living in Habitats?

<br><br>But there are more of course:
- The Gold Refinery was actually a Communications Tower. According to the plot we are Mech Commanders. Or are we just floating brain tissue in a plastic tube? Yay! So we are the master mind sitting on a massive spaceship in isolation so probably we need some kind of stable radio communication device on the planet surface.
- There was also a Life Support Plant that was probably supposed to ensure the stable operation of **Habitats** and **Eco-Spheres** but later became an **Alien Derelict**.
- And there was the holy grail, the **Shield Generator**! Which became the **Monopole Mine** which became an **Alien Derelict**. A shield generator would have been so awesome. It was in Supreme Commander to say the least. It would have changed the game mechanics considerably though and I cannot even imagine how would it have worked in a turn based game.
- And finally there was the Master Builder which can be seen in one of the in-game videos moving around slowly. It was a deployable mining station which is suspiciously similar to the one in Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Maybe that is exactly the reason why it was cut from the game. Note that in the below video I defined this unit to be a building to find it easier in the unit selection menu but of course it was a mobile land unit originally.
<br><br>The below video demonstrates most of the discussed units from the above list.
