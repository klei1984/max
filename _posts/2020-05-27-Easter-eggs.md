Found some easter eggs :)
<!--more-->
<br><br>
The first two were hidden within the in-game help system.
{% include drive_player.html id=page.driveId %}
<br>
The third one is not that obvious. I could not find it in-game yet. The game asset is an actual unit called Waldo. More precisely Dead Waldo.

Its a pop culture reference to [Where's Waldo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F).
Even he's magical walking cane is there next to the corpse :D
